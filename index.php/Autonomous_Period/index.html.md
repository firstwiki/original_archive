**Autonomous mode** refers to the short period in the beginning of a match where the [robot](robot) operates without any user input, relying on pre-programmed code to operate the robot.

## History

Autonomous began in the 2003 game [Stack Attack](Stack_Attack "Stack Attack"), primarily as a means to make the [programming](programming) aspect of [FIRST](first) more exciting and challenging. Since then, the autonomous mode persisted to the [next game](FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"), and has been apart of all [FRC](FRC "FRC") games since.

In 2003, the main options for autonomous mode included [line following](line-following) and [dead reckoning](dead-reckoning). In 2004, the addition of an [IR beacon](IR_beacon "IR beacon") and [IR sensor](tsop34840) added the ability to hone into the beacon to complete a certain task to earn points. Years after 2004 have included opportunities for [sensors](sensor) such as a camera or IR remote although teams still have the ability to do what they wish in autonomous as long as they are not limited by the rules.
