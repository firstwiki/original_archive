## History

Autonomous began in the 2003 game [Stack Attack](/index.php/Stack_Attack
"Stack Attack" ), primarily as a means to make the
[programming](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ) aspect of
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) more exciting and challenging. Since then,
the autonomous mode persisted to the [next
game](/index.php/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"
), and has been apart of all [FRC](/index.php/FRC "FRC" ) games since.

In 2003, the main options for autonomous mode included [line
following](/index.php/Line_following "Line following" ) and [dead
reckoning](/index.php/Dead_reckoning "Dead reckoning" ). In 2004, the addition
of an [IR beacon](/index.php/IR_beacon "IR beacon" ) and [IR
sensor](/index.php/IR_sensor "IR sensor" ) added the ability to hone into the
beacon to complete a certain task to earn points. Years after 2004 have
included opportunities for [sensors](/index.php/Sensors "Sensors" ) such as a
camera or IR remote although teams still have the ability to do what they wish
in autonomous as long as they are not limited by the rules.
