**Autonomous mode** refers to the short period in the beginning of a match where the [robot](Robot "Robot" ) operates without any user input, relying on pre-programmed code to operate the robot. 


## History

Autonomous began in the 2003 game [Stack Attack](Stack_Attack
"Stack Attack" ), primarily as a means to make the
[programming](Programming "Programming" ) aspect of
[FIRST](first) more exciting and challenging. Since then,
the autonomous mode persisted to the [next
game](FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"
), and has been apart of all [FRC](FRC "FRC" ) games since.

In 2003, the main options for autonomous mode included [line
following](Line_following "Line following" ) and [dead
reckoning](Dead_reckoning "Dead reckoning" ). In 2004, the addition
of an [IR beacon](IR_beacon "IR beacon" ) and [IR
sensor](IR_sensor "IR sensor" ) added the ability to hone into the
beacon to complete a certain task to earn points. Years after 2004 have
included opportunities for [sensors](Sensors "Sensors" ) such as a
camera or IR remote although teams still have the ability to do what they wish
in autonomous as long as they are not limited by the rules.
