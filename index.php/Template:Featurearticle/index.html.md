A **[drivetrain](/index.php/Drivetrain "Drivetrain" )** consists of components
necessary to allow a robot to move. The interaction of those parts, which
includes motors and transmissions, result in a robot that is either fast or
slow. Good drivetrains result in robots that are maneuverable, fast, and
capable of pushing items on the field. Common types of drivetrains used in
FIRST include [six-wheel drive](/index.php/Drivetrain#Six_Wheel_Drive
"Drivetrain" ), [swerve drive](/index.php/Drivetrain#Swerve_Drive "Drivetrain"
), and [mecanum drive](/index.php/Drivetrain#Mecanum_Drive "Drivetrain" ).
