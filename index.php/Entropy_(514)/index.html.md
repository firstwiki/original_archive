##  Construction

**Collector:** Consists of a rotating PVC drum paralell to the ground, that picks the balls up by rotating into the robot, pulling them up onto the track. 

**Track:** Serves a double purpose, as both being the transportation to the launcher, as well as a storage area until they are ready to be launched. The track itself was constructed out of an aluminum frame, a treadmill track, and parts of a belt sander, giving the robot it's infamous nickname _"Sandy holes"_

**Launcher:** A rotary launcher that functions similar to a pitching machine. It is constructed with an aluminum frame and a 10.5" rubber wheelchair wheel.
