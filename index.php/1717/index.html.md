##  Overview

The D'Penguineers have participated in FIRST since 2006, and already have a
successful program. The team is composed entirely of high school senior
students, who must be admitted into the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy to be
considered for team member status. The Engineering Academy offers a dedicated
4-year curriculum of math and science instruction, focusing on applied
knowledge. The team's funding is derived from local sponsors, especially the
Goleta division of Raytheon, who lend personal support as well as funding.

Each year, the team is composed of roughly thirty seniors and the design,
programming, and fabrication of the robot is done entirely by the students.
Their mentors, especially head mentor and teacher Amir Abo-Shaeer, play a
significant role in preparing the all-rookie team each year.

##  History

The team's first two years were met with moderate success. They won a [Rookie
All-Star award](/index.php/Rookie_All-Star_award "Rookie All-Star award" ) in
2006, but did not qualify for Championships the following year. In 2008, they
burst onto the scene, winning two regionals and becoming the second highest
seed in their Championship Division. They selected [254](/index.php/254 "254"
) and [384](/index.php/384 "384" ) and reached the Division Finals, where they
were defeated by what would be that year's eventual champions,
[1114](/index.php/1114 "1114" ), [217](/index.php/217 "217" ), and
[148](/index.php/148 "148" ). In 2009, they became one of the few teams in
FIRST to go undefeated in a regional, doing so at Sacramento, and they again
reached the Championship Division Finals, and were again defeated by the
eventual winners of the Championship. 2010 was marked by less success. They
were knocked out of alliance selections at Championships after losing their
last match by one point. They finished as Quarter-finalists. In 2011, team
1717 did not win a regional, but significantly improved their robot for
Championships, where they were the second highest seed in their Division. They
picked teams [67](/index.php/67 "67" ) and [2751](/index.php/2751 "2751" ),
but unfortunately lost in the semi-finals to teams [71](/index.php/71 "71" ),
[2826](/index.php/2826 "2826" ), and [103](/index.php/103 "103" ).

The book _The New Cool_ was written about the 2009 team and was published in
2011.
