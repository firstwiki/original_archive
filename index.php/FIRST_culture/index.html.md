The **FIRST subculture** is based largely on the idea of [gracious
professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism" ), extending from the more general [FIRST
philosophy](/index.php/FIRST_philosophy "FIRST philosophy" ). FIRST is largely
made up into the culture by the people who occupy it (see
[FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTers&action=edit "FIRSTers" )).

The FIRST community is surprisingly tight knit for a group so widely spread
across the country. Part of what makes this unity are uniquely FIRST inside
jokes (see [FIRST humor](/index.php/FIRST_humor "FIRST humor" )) and other
traditions. It is not uncommon for
[FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTers&action=edit "FIRSTers" ) to meet via
[ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" ) or some other online
communication and then arrange meetings at [Regionals](/index.php/Regional
"Regional" ) or in non-FIRST related activities.
