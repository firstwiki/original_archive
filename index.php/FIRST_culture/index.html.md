The **FIRST subculture** is based largely on the idea of [gracious professionalism](Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism"), extending from the more general [FIRST philosophy](FIRST_philosophy "FIRST philosophy"). FIRST is largely made up into the culture by the people who occupy it (see [FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTers&action=edit "FIRSTers")).

The FIRST community is surprisingly tight knit for a group so widely spread across the country. Part of what makes this unity are uniquely FIRST inside jokes (see [FIRST humor](FIRST_humor "FIRST humor")) and other traditions. It is not uncommon for [FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTers&action=edit "FIRSTers") to meet via [ChiefDelphi](ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi") or some other online communication and then arrange meetings at [Regionals](Regional "Regional") or in non-FIRST related activities.
