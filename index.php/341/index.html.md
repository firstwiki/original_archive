## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

341 considers itself well-rounded, stating that is has "progressed in all
areas, not just on the field." In its [rookie year](/index.php/Game_%282000%29
"Game \(2000\)" ), 341 won the [Rookie All-Star Award](/index.php/Rookie_All-
Star_Award "Rookie All-Star Award" ) at the [Philadelphia
Regional](/index.php/Philadelphia_Regional "Philadelphia Regional" ). 341 also
hosts [Ramp Riot](/index.php/Ramp_Riot "Ramp Riot" ), begining in that year.

In [2001](/index.php/Game_%282001%29 "Game \(2001\)" ), 341 won the [Ford
Motor Company Best Team
Award](/index.php?title=Ford_Motor_Company_Best_Team_Award&action=edit "Ford
Motor Company Best Team Award" ) at the [Championship
Event](/index.php/Championship_Event "Championship Event" ) in Florida. They
were also champions at their own Ramp Riot. In the [next
season](/index.php/Game_%282002%29 "Game \(2002\)" ), the team won
[DaimlerChrysler Team Spirit
Award](/index.php/DaimlerChrysler_Team_Spirit_Award "DaimlerChrysler Team
Spirit Award" ) at the [Long Island Regional](/index.php/Long_Island_Regional
"Long Island Regional" ), [Judges Award](/index.php/Judges_Award "Judges

same season one of the team members won a $40,000 scholarship to Drexel
University (hosts of the Philadelphia Regional) at the [Championship
Event](/index.php/Championship_Event "Championship Event" ).

In [2003](/index.php/Game_%282003%29 "Game \(2003\)" ), 341 decided to forego
having engineers building the robot, instead opting for a fully student-built
robot. The decision reflected well in the accomplishments. The team won four
awards that year, two of which were the [Regional Chairman's
Award](/index.php/Regional_Chairman%27s_Award "Regional Chairman's Award" )
and the [Leadership in Control Award](/index.php/Leadership_in_Control_Award
"Leadership in Control Award" ). (Both were received at the [Philadelphia
Regional](/index.php/Philadelphia_Regional "Philadelphia Regional" ).) The
other awards were won at the [Championship
Event](/index.php/Championship_Event "Championship Event" ), the [Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship
Award](/index.php/Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_%26_Byers_Entrepreneurship_Award
"Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award" ), and the Galileo
Division Champion in the National Final Four.

In [2007](/index.php?title=Game_%282007%29&action=edit "Game \(2007\)" ), 341
traveled to NJ for the first time and won the [Team Spirit
Award](/index.php/Team_Spirit_Award "Team Spirit Award" ). At Chesapeake they
went 5-1-1, ranked 6th overall and lost in the Semifinals. Dina Campagna, one
of our mentors won the [Woodie Flowers Award](/index.php/Woodie_Flowers_Award
"Woodie Flowers Award" ). Philadelphia was amazing, pairing up with Chuck
[84](/index.php/84 "84" ) and Birds of Pray [181](/index.php/181 "181" ) the
team walked home with their first regional win ever and recieved the
[Engineering Inspiration Award](/index.php/Engineering_Inspiration_Award
"Engineering Inspiration Award" ). In Alanta, the [Championship
Event](/index.php/Championship_Event "Championship Event" ) took 7th overall
seed only losing 1 match.
