## Build

Immediately after the kickoff event ended, we sprung into action. The following week was spent on intense design discussions. We decided to split the game into three phases: collect balls, store balls, shoot balls. The collection problem was swiftly solved (at least in concept) by our noticing of the fact that hairbrushes were able to grip the balls with ease. This idea reemerged once we finalized our storage and conveyance device. Our final design was a spiral of extremely thin aluminum enclosed by an equally thin layer of Lexan sheeting. A column of revolving brushes stood proudly in the center of our cylindrical construction, propelling the balls up the slight, consistent grade to our flywheel. This integrated smoothly with the aptly named "acquisitor," which flung the orbs nearly a foot vertically to where they would be stored for later use. The flywheel floated gracefully near the top of the spiral, supported by a delicate construction of metal tubing.

The final component of Joshua yet to be described, the drivetrain, deserves the most attention. We originally hoped to utilize a powerful and stable tread-based system so as to maximize our defensive potential and to prevent our robot from being translated in the slightest during our firing procedures. We also wished to ascend the rather steep ramp at the conclusion of each match. Our dreams were soon shattered, sadly, as the treads we chose could not adequately handle turning, and snapped. Springing into action once again, we changed our drivetrain so that it used four wheels rather than treads. While our turning issues were resolved, we were still unable to ascend the ramp. As such, we incorporated a middle set of wheels, bringing our total to six. We also added a gear shifting mechanism similar to that used on our robot from the previous year. Due to the dissimilarities between the two robots, however, the gear shifter did not operate as intended, and was soon removed. Throughout all of this, we were still incapable of climbing the ramp, and since the central two wheels had been inserted for balance and thus were not powered, we removed them, leaving us with our truly final design.

## Robot

With his towering, brush-driven spiral and spinning ball "aquisitor," Joshua proved the versatility of hair-care products. With a flywheel modeled after that seen during the kickoff event, Joshua was able to accurately fling balls from any angle into the upper goal. He was able to score balls in the lower goals as well simply by reversing the brushes in both the spiral storage system and the aforementioned "aquisitor." Joshua's drivetrain underwent multiple revisions, leading to a final product which allowed for speedy and agile traversal of the field due to multiple omni wheels. This combination allowed him to become a finalist at the New York City regional competition.

Joshua was named after the grandson of two of our chief sponsors, Larry and Yvette Gralla.

### Robot Functions

- capable of scoring balls in either set of goals
- strong, defensive drivetrain
- can acquire balls from either the top of the spiral (human-loaded) or the floor (independently)
- autonomously score up to 10 balls in the lower goal

### Robot Strategy

Our original strategy was to strike an even balance between scoring in the upper goal and playing defense. If we saw that the atmosphere of the match was such that "aiming high" was an impossibility, we could swiftly switch to focusing on the lower goals.
