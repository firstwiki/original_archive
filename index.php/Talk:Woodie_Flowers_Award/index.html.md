Was this taken from a copyrighted source, IE the FIRST website or manual?

    I believe all the award articles were copied from the manual ... I complained about this sometime back, but it slipped my mind. It is doubtful that FIRST will sue us, but we really should show better form. Anyway, if we purport to be of any use, we shouldn't be a random collection of what other people say -- rather we should add to it, and explain the history and the importance, etc. of the award (or any article in general). Messing with copyrights is bad stuff ... /end rant --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 17:06, 11 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    FIRST has no interest in sueing their fansite. In my view, copying from the manual is fine if you acknowledge it. However, it's only good as a stopgap. --[Aaeamdar](User:Aaeamdar "User:Aaeamdar" ) 00:03, 15 Jan 2007 (EST)
