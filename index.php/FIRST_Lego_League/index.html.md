[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) Lego League, or [FLL](/index.php/FLL "FLL"
) was founded in 1998, in a partnership between [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ) and the [LEGO Corporation](/index.php/LEGO_Corporation "LEGO
Corporation" ). As an offshoot of the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ), FLL was designed for a younger audience using the [Lego
Mindstorms](/index.php/Lego_Mindstorms "Lego Mindstorms" ) kits. Students
involved in FLL build small LEGO robots, that traverse a 4' by 8' playing
field to accomplish tasks related around a core theme.

#  Robot Challenge

Each year in September, the official FLL game is released. Special playing
field components, all made of LEGO's, are used to simulate real world things,
like polar bears for the Arctic Impact Challenge, or astronaut housing modules
for the Mission Mars Challenge. From this date until their first competition,
which is roughly 8 weeks, teams have to design, build, and program fully-
autonomous robots made entirely of LEGO parts.

##  Current Year Challenge

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRST_LEGO_League&action=edit&section=3 "Edit
section: Research Assignment" )]

#  Research Assignment

In addition to the robot challenge, FLL teams also are required to do a
'Research Assignment', about modern problems in society related to the core
theme of that year's FLL Challenge. For example, in the No Limits challenge,
teams had to come up with a robotic device to help disabled people, and
present anything from the concept to a fully functional, completed device to a
panel of judges.

#  Events

After the 8-week build season in over, FLL teams compete at one of over 200
regional [FLL Events](/index.php/Category:FLL_Events "Category:FLL Events" ).
Here, teams usually have three or more [rounds](/index.php/Round "Round" ) in
which they compete with their LEGO robot on the official playing field. Teams
also present their Research Assignments, technical aspects of their robots,
and how the team works together to three separate panels of judges.

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRST_LEGO_League&action=edit&section=5 "Edit
section: Awards" )]

##  Awards

The highest award an FLL team can receive is the Champions Award (formerly
known as the Directors Award.) This award is given to the team that has shown
impressive robot performance, technical design, research, and teamwork. All
four aspects are weighed equally. Winning the Champions Award at the regional
level is the only way for an FLL team to reach the World Festival, where they
fill one of roughly 80 spots. There, they compete in 3 matches, and present
their research, technical, and teamwork once again, alongside
[FTC](/index.php/FTC "FTC" ) and [FRC](/index.php/FRC "FRC" ) teams.
