## History

Hopkins High School initially joined FIRST Robotics in 1994\. This original team was the first team in Minnesota and was called Cogsquad Team

# [6](6 "6"). Due to the loss of sponsors in 2004, the team could

no longer participate, and had to forfeit the name and number to the sponsors. This team last participated in the 2001, 2002, and 2003 Florida regionals, and placed 3rd overall in Nationals. Hopkins robotics reformed once again in 2007 as a "rookie" team, and is once again climbing the ranks as a FIRST team.
