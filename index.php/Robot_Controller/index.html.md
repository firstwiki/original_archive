The **Robot Controller**, or **RC** is the unit of the [control
system](/index.php/Control_system "Control system" ) that processes
[input](/index.php/Input "Input" ), is responsible for
[communication](/index.php/Radio_modem "Radio modem" ), and controls the robot
through various [outputs](/index.php/Output "Output" ). There are two types of
Robot Controllers -- the Full-size version and the controller from the
[Robovation](/index.php/Robovation "Robovation" ) kit.

The Full-size Robot Controller receives data from the [Operator
Interface](/index.php/Operator_Interface "Operator Interface" ), and controls
the [spike relays](/index.php/Spike "Spike" ), [motors](/index.php/Motors
"Motors" ), and [servos](/index.php/Servo "Servo" ). It is the unit that is
[programmed](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ).


## History

The RC tends to change slightly from year to year, where most of the change is
slight improvements.

There have been major changes, however. In 2000, the [BASIC
Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp" ) was switched
from [BS2](/index.php/BS2 "BS2" ) to [BS2sx](/index.php/BS2sx "BS2sx" ). In
2003, an [autonomous mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" )
feature was implemented. The most significant change, though, occurred in
2004, when the basic processor was changed from a [BASIC
Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp" ) to a [PIC
chip](/index.php/PIC_chip "PIC chip" ). In 2009, the RC was completely thrown
out for the National Instruments [cRIO](/index.php/CRIO "CRIO" ).

To learn more about the multiple varieties of the RC, see their specific
pages.
