The **Robot Controller**, or **RC** is the unit of the [control
system](Control_system "Control system" ) that processes
[input](Input "Input" ), is responsible for
[communication](Radio_modem "Radio modem" ), and controls the robot
through various [outputs](Output "Output" ). There are two types of
Robot Controllers -- the Full-size version and the controller from the
[Robovation](robovation) kit.

The Full-size Robot Controller receives data from the [Operator
Interface](operator-interface), and controls
the [spike relays](spike-relay), [motors](Motors
"Motors" ), and [servos](Servo "Servo" ). It is the unit that is
[programmed](Programming "Programming" ).


## History

The RC tends to change slightly from year to year, where most of the change is
slight improvements.

There have been major changes, however. In 2000, the [BASIC
Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp" ) was switched
from [BS2](BS2 "BS2" ) to [BS2sx](BS2sx "BS2sx" ). In
2003, an [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" )
feature was implemented. The most significant change, though, occurred in
2004, when the basic processor was changed from a [BASIC
Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp" ) to a [PIC
chip](PIC_chip "PIC chip" ). In 2009, the RC was completely thrown
out for the National Instruments [cRIO](CRIO "CRIO" ).

To learn more about the multiple varieties of the RC, see their specific
pages.
