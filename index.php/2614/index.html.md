## History

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team 2614 (MARS) was created in 2008 by a
group of FIRST LEGO League (FLL) students. The inaugural MARS team had 12
students and 4 mentors, most of whom met each other for the first time the day
of kickoff. Students on the MARS team come primarily from the traditionally
rival Morgantown and University High Schools but over the years students from
Point Pleasant and East Fairmont High Schools (as well as several home-
schoolers) have joined the team.


## Team Projects

  * Summer and Fall 2011 - The MARS team designed, built, and tested a shifting 6 Wheel Drive with internally-run belts. The team also moved into a new, larger work-space in preparation for the 2012 season. 
  * Summer Challenge "Cube Capture" - For 2010 off-season the MARS team created a mock competition designed to teach both new and veteran students new skills. The competition was structured in such a way as to encourage the development of techniques in areas that we felt we were weakest in. The challenge came complete with an eleven section rule book. 
  * Parade Bot - In the summer of 2009 MARS began construction of a community demonstration robot in the shape of our mascot. It has a mecanum drive base with a self-contained backpack control unit and is very easy for young children to drive. It has a computer monitor for a face and speakers for ears, making it the ideal presentation robot. Using its arms it has already cut a ribbon and broken ground for two new buildings on the West Virginia University campus. 
  * BETA Testing - MARS assisted FRC team 1629 (GaCo) in testing the new FRC control system in the fall of 2008.

## MARS is Helping Create a FIRST Community in West Virginia

  * FIRST LEGO League (FLL) - Since the very beginning MARS has been a huge supporter of FLL. This past year (2011) we sponsored and or mentored mentored ~40 FLL teams in North-Central West Virginia and Southern Pennsylvania and we hope to continue growing the program. MARS runs a scrimmage for the FLL teams we sponsor in order to prepare them for the WV State Championship where MARS students also volunteer. 
  * MARS has a goal of making FIRST available to all students in West Virginia and we have begun implementing a plan to make this goal a reality. 
  * Meet our sister team, PARTs (Putnam Area Robotics Team) (Team #3492) [[5]](https://sites.google.com/a/team3492.org/putnam-area-robotics-team-p-a-r-t-s/home-1 "https://sites.google.com/a/team3492.org/putnam-area-robotics-team-p-a-r-t-s/home-1" )
