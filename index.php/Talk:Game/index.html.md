Should this be moved to [Games (FRC)](/index.php?title=Games_%28FRC%29&action=edit "Games \(FRC\)"). Or should that point to [Games](/index.php?title=Games&action=edit "Games"), with a notice of [Games (FLL)](/index.php?title=Games_%28FLL%29&action=edit "Games \(FLL\)")? And in that regard, I don't think we have a convention on plural titles, ... I've noticed a mix at times. Should it be [Game](Game "Game") or [Games](/index.php?title=Games&action=edit "Games") as the predominant name, with the other being a referral? --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 15:25, 2 Jul 2004 (EDT)

I'd opt for [Game](Game "Game"). Adding to my list of potential name changes on [FIRSTwiki:Village pump](FIRSTwiki:Village_pump "FIRSTwiki:Village pump"). --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 15:32, 2 Jul 2004 (EDT)

Can someone load the actual docs in ZIP? I can cover the '04 game. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 22:00, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Since the time spans before and after 2000, maybe including the full four digit year number would be better style? I strained at what I was looking at, in the least. [JosephM](/index.php?title=JosephM&action=edit "JosephM") started out one way and switched to the other, so I'll refrain from changing it myself for now, to see if there's a reason or if the current way is preferred. Away, and avaunt! --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 22:23, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT)

we use 4 digits everywhere else, might as well keep it the same. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:32, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT)

If anyone cares to, I found a bunch of info on past games via [The Internet Archive](http://archive.org "http://archive.org"). Simply enter a URL like this:

```

```

into the wayback engine and it will give you a good summary.

Was 2002 the first year FIRST put the docs online?

Ok, I'm beggining a repository for the original file docs. If anyone is interested in helping me, pm/e-mail me and I'll send you a directory listing. If I can get it on-line, that'd be awesome. If not, I'll just zip it for anyone who wants it. (So far, the whole thing is 89.7 MiB)--[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 21:42, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT)
