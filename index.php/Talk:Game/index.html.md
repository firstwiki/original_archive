Should this be moved to [Games
(FRC)](/index.php?title=Games_%28FRC%29&action=edit "Games \(FRC\)" ). Or
should that point to [Games](/index.php?title=Games&action=edit "Games" ),
with a notice of [Games (FLL)](/index.php?title=Games_%28FLL%29&action=edit
"Games \(FLL\)" )? And in that regard, I don't think we have a convention on
plural titles, ... I've noticed a mix at times. Should it be
[Game](/index.php/Game "Game" ) or [Games](/index.php?title=Games&action=edit
"Games" ) as the predominant name, with the other being a referral?

I'd opt for [Game](/index.php/Game "Game" ). Adding to my list of potential
name changes on [FIRSTwiki:Village pump](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Village_pump
"FIRSTwiki:Village pump" ). --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:32, 2

Can someone load the actual docs in ZIP? I can cover the '04 game.

Since the time spans before and after 2000, maybe including the full four
digit year number would be better style? I strained at what I was looking at,
in the least. [JosephM](/index.php?title=JosephM&action=edit "JosephM" )
started out one way and switched to the other, so I'll refrain from changing
it myself for now, to see if there's a reason or if the current way is
preferred. Away, and avaunt! --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" )

    we use 4 digits everywhere else, might as well keep it the same. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:32, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

If anyone cares to, I found a bunch of info on past games via [The Internet
Archive](http://archive.org "http://archive.org" ). Simply enter a URL like
this:

    
    
    http://www.swindsor.k12.ct.us/first/old first/archive/95/1995.htm

into the wayback engine and it will give you a good summary.

    Was 2002 the first year FIRST put the docs online?

Ok, I'm beggining a repository for the original file docs. If anyone is
interested in helping me, pm/e-mail me and I'll send you a directory listing.
If I can get it on-line, that'd be awesome. If not, I'll just zip it for
anyone who wants it. (So far, the whole thing is 89.7
