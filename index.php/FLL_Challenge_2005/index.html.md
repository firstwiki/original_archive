The [FLL Challenge](/index.php/FLL_Challenge "FLL Challenge" ) theme for 2005
was Ocean Odyssey. FLL teams were tasked to compete in this year's Robot Game,
as well as research our world's Oceans to help come up with solutions to
protect this vital resource.

The challenge was released on September 12th, with the bulk of Official State
tournaments occuring in December. The season will conclude with the FLL World
Festival to be held in conjunction with the FIRST Championship event in April
2006. Over 60,000 kids from 31 countries participated in this FLL season.

A quote from the website...

"In 2005, FIRST LEGO League is exploring one of our planet's most precious
resources. Sending out an S.O.S. -- Register your team and help us answer the
ocean's distress call!"


## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of
LEGO on it related to that year's theme. A robot is built entirely from Lego
Mindstorms kits and Lego pieces to autonomously complete the missions on the
board. Each [mission](/index.php/Mission "Mission" ) has a specific point
value. To see this year's [missions](/index.php/Mission "Mission" ), point
values, and so forth, go to [the 2005 Robot

## The Project

As part of the First Lego League competition teams are also given a research
project related to that year's theme. The exact challenge varies from year to
year but will include researching a topic in detail, coming up with some sort
of problem solution, and presenting a short, creative presentation to the
judges to communicate your solution. This year's research project is of course
about oceans. For details, go to [the 2005
