Thanks for keeping FIRSTwiki from completely going to the dogs!

Thanks, I do enjoy keeping things cleaned up in here. I remember when I first
registered, we had all those spambots and the place was a pit. I find I have a
lot of free time, so I just help out wherever I can. Now if only we could get
more people to actively use this wiki. :D
