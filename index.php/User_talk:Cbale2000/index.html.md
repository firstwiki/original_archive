Thanks for keeping FIRSTwiki from completely going to the dogs! --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 22:11, 4 January 2008 (EST)

Thanks, I do enjoy keeping things cleaned up in here. I remember when I first registered, we had all those spambots and the place was a pit. I find I have a lot of free time, so I just help out wherever I can. Now if only we could get more people to actively use this wiki. :D [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000") 23:34, 4 January 2008 (EST)
