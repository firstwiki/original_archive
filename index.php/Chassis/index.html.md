A **chassis** is the fundamental rigid frame on and around which a
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) is built.

Overview" )]

##  Overview

The chassis consists of rigid members that together comprise a frame. It is on
and within these chassis frame members that the components of the robot are
installed, including [drive trains](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train" ),
[motors](/index.php/Motor "Motor" ), [pneumatics](/index.php/Pneumatics
"Pneumatics" ), electronics, and nearly everything else. It is important that
the chassis be well-designed to keep everything together in a sensible way
that does not inhibit mobility. Given the restrictions on the robot's design,
the weight of the chassis must also be considered.

##  Materials

Many different materials can be used for the chassis, and the [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) provided basic chassis members
in [2005](/index.php/Triple_Play "Triple Play" ) and
[2006](/index.php/Aim_High "Aim High" ). These were
[prefabricated](/index.php/Fabrication "Fabrication" ) members designed to
interlock via notch-shaped pieces and many holes that also saved weight. They
were made of [aluminum](/index.php/Aluminum "Aluminum" ), which is very light
and easy to work with while still being durable. Chassis members and frames
can also be made of [steel](/index.php/Steel "Steel" ), which is heavy but
extremely durable, wood, or plastic such as [HDPE](/index.php/HDPE "HDPE" ).
The choice of materials is crucial to the effectiveness of a chassis design.
