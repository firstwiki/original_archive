# TTL port

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The "TTL port" is a serial port which is configurable for either
synchronous(transmission timing is controlled using a clock signal from a
master) or asynchronous serial operation.

The TTL serial port is useful for interfacing to a number of things including
other microprocessors and a variety of sensors.

For further information on using the TTL serial port, see the PIC18F8520
datasheet and the C18 compiler library reference. Both can be found at the
Microchip website.
