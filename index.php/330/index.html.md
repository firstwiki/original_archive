## History

  * 1997: [Team 61](Team_61 "Team 61" ) \- Circuit Breakers _(Defunct)_

In 1997, Hope Chapel Academy was one of four pioneering local schools to join
forces and form the Southern California Circuit Breakers.

* * *

  * 1998: [Team 82](Team_82 "Team 82" ) \- Beach Bot _(Redesignated)_

In 1998, one year removed from the Circuit Breakers collaboration, Hope Chapel
Academy took its leave of the alliance and formed its own team, known as Beach
Bot.

* * *

  * 1999 - present: [Team 330](Team_330 "Team 330" ) \- Beach Bot 

After the 1998 season, [Team 82](Team_82 "Team 82" )'s main
sponsor, Hughes Space and Communication, decided not to sponsor the team for
another year. Due to a now-abandoned FIRST rule (which required that a team be
assigned a new number if its major sponsor changed), the Beach Bot team was
redesignated as [Team 330](Team_330 "Team 330" ).

## Accomplishments

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.
