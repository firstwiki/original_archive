## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

We've been in the FIRST Robotics Competition since Fall of 1999. Here's some
info on our last years:


### 2000

  * In our rookie year, 2000, we got into FIRST having no clue what it was about, Mr. Foley, Mrs. Cassans and all of us students worked very hard. It all paid off for, we won the Rookie Award in the Long Island Regional. We also won Motorola Quality Award and Most Robust Robot. Although we lost in the finals, we went to Nationals where we were ranked in the Top 100. 


### 2001

:Med_team358_01.jpg "Image:Med_team358_01.jpg" )

  * During our second season, in 2001, we gained new advisors and engineers. During this year we were able to mentor the Mechanical Bull's (810) rookie season. We were ranked in the top 50% at the Long Island Regional and were in the Top 100 at Nationals. 


### 2002

[![Image:Med_team358_02.jpg](/media/f/f1/Med_team358_02.jpg)](/index.php/Image
:Med_team358_02.jpg "Image:Med_team358_02.jpg" )

  * In 2002, in the Long Island Regional, we won the Best Play Award (for crushing the MouseBot, sorry about that!) and the GM Industrial Design Award. We went into the finals ranked 10th, but came out in 4th place. 
    * In the New York City Regional went into the finals in 4th place and took 1st place with the SIE H20 BOTS (T.R.I.B.E.) (237). From there we went to Nationals. In Nationals we were ranked in the Top 100 of our division. 


### 2003

[![Image:Med_team358_03.jpg](/media/4/4e/Med_team358_03.jpg)](/index.php/Image
:Med_team358_03.jpg "Image:Med_team358_03.jpg" )

  * In 2003, we started great, we built a prototype by cannibalizing the 2002 and 2001 robots. Than after some extra hours and a few design changes, we finished building the robot - it came out great! 
    * In the New Hampshire Regional, we won the Xerox Creative Design Award and came in third in both the seeding rounds and the finals along with Krunch (79) and F.O.R.C.E. (1073). 
    * In the Long Island Regional, we won Delphi's "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" Award and the Johnson &amp; Johnson Sportsmanship Award for donating the practice field. We were undefeated and came in first in the seeding rounds, we picked R.A.G.E. (173) and The Duck Tape Bandits to be our allies, but we were knocked out in the first round of the elimination rounds. 
    * At Nationals, we had some technical difficulties, and were seeded 58th in our division. For the first time we made it into the finals, [Da Bears (247)](/index.php/247 "247" ) and Team [525](/index.php/525 "525" ) picked us to be allied with them. We played the first match against [R.A.G.E. (173)](/index.php/173 "173" ) and [Team Hot (67)](/index.php/67 "67" ). Unfortunately we were knocked out in the quarter finals. 


### 2004

[![Image:Med_team358_04.jpg](/media/9/91/Med_team358_04.jpg)](/index.php/Image
:Med_team358_04.jpg "Image:Med_team358_04.jpg" )

  * In 2004 we made many improvements from organizing our room to internal organization of the club. We also gained another advisor, Mr. Plouffe! For [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar](/index.php/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar" ), we attended the [SPBLI Long Island Regional](/index.php?title=SPBLI_Long_Island_Regional&action=edit "SPBLI Long Island Regional" ), the [Philadelphia Regional](/index.php/Philadelphia_Regional "Philadelphia Regional" ) and [Nationals](/index.php?title=Nationals&action=edit "Nationals" ) in Georgia. 
    * At the [SBPLI Long Island Regional](/index.php/SBPLI_Long_Island_Regional "SBPLI Long Island Regional" ) we were Seeded 18th and thanks to the [Duct Tape Bandits (team 467)](/index.php/467 "467" ) for picking us and Team [527](/index.php/527 "527" ) for rounding out our alliance. We made it to the semi-finals and won two awards - the Johnson and Johnson Sportsmanship Award for helping Smithtown (team 810) with their drive train and for donating the practice field again, and the Leadership in Control Award for use of the gyro and wheel encoders. At the [SBPLI Long Island Regional](/index.php/SBPLI_Long_Island_Regional "SBPLI Long Island Regional" ) the winner of the Outstanding Volunteer Award went to [Hans Zobel](/index.php?title=Hans_Zobel&action=edit "Hans Zobel" )! We'd like to send a special thank you to him, and all of [FESTO](/index.php?title=FESTO&action=edit "FESTO" ) for their continued support. 
    * During the [Philadelphia Regional](/index.php/Philadelphia_Regional "Philadelphia Regional" ) we were seeded 11th and ended up as the 7th place alliance captain. We picked teams [87](/index.php/87 "87" ) and [1113](/index.php/1113 "1113" ) to be with us. In the quarter finals we had an exciting series with one tie, one win and two losses. 
    * At [Nationals](/index.php?title=Nationals&action=edit "Nationals" ) we advanced the farther than ever before. After the qualifying rounds, we were seeding 15th out of 72 teams in the Galileo division. We were picked by the [Northern Knights (296)](/index.php/296 "296" ), along with [Miss Daisy (341)](/index.php/341 "341" ) for the playoffs and made it into the quarter finals.

## Team projects

In-Flight refueling - We collaborated with Northrop Grumman to retrofit our
2005 robot to "fly" like an aircraft to test some in-flight refueling
concepts. Controls were added and coded to behave just like the aircraft pitch
and yaw controls (ailerons, rudder) as well as throttle. Then the pilots
tested "flying" different configurations to dock for mid-air refueling, under
both daylight and night conditions.

Robotics Class Robot - We setup our 2005 practice robot for the Robotics class
to dismantle and reassemble as a learning tool.
