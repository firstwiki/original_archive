## History

The TechnoKats Robotics Team [(technokats.org)](http://www.technokats.org
"http://www.technokats.org" ) competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition
[(usfirst.org)](http://www.usfirst.org "http://www.usfirst.org" ) as “team
45”.

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) focuses on
inspiring students in math, science, and technology fields through sponsoring
a nationwide robotics competition. Many students and adults get very excited
about competing in this challenging and fun atmosphere.

The 2006-2007 season is the sixteenth year for the TechnoKats and FIRST. In
1992, the Delco Electronics - Kokomo/Center Schools partnership was one of 28
teams to compete in the inaugural FIRST Competition. Since then, FIRST has
grown to include over 1000 teams in numerous countries. During this time, the
team’s partnership has also grown. Over the years, Delco became a division of
Delphi, Ivy Tech became a TechnoKat supporting partner, and the TechnoKats
have made a name for themselves in Howard County and the FIRST community.

We are proud of our history. We have a strong tradition of competing at a high
level in FIRST while also being a model team in showing “gracious
professionalism” as we compete. We have mentored many teams, both in Indiana
and across North America. These teams and others in the FIRST community look
to the TechnoKats as a model FIRST team. We continually strive to uphold that
model for how a FIRST team should be organized and how they should compete.

During these many years, the team has been led by the partnership between
Delphi and the Kokomo Center School Corporation. KACC teacher Tim Railey has
served as team leader from the high school side of the partnership for 12 of
those 13 years, and he was even involved during the first season in ’92. The
success and stability of the team is a direct result of the strong partnership
between Delphi-D and KCSC, and to the dedication of Tim. There has been much
engineering leadership from Delphi during these years also. Various engineers
have led the team, while Andy Baker has served as the engineering team leader
since 2000.

Many students have been TechnoKats. Many have gone on to work as engineers,
scientists, and entrepreneurs in various fields. We have alumni working in the
automotive industry, for companies like Delphi and GM. Other alumni work in
aerospace, information technology, consumer electronics, and healthcare. We
are sure that being a TechnoKat played a big role in their success today.

## Accomplishments

**This Accomplishments section needs to be split into separate articles.**   
This section should be for a few Major accomplishments that deserve to be
highlighted.  
Additional accomplishments should be moved to the appropriate Team/Year page.

More important than getting awards, students are getting inspired. Many
TechnoKat alumni are pursuing science and engineering majors at prominent
universities, while many have begun technical careers in the workforce. This
is proof that FIRST is inspiring and that being a TechnoKat is rewarding.
Along with students getting inspired, engineers and teachers are having fun
while sharpening their design, teaching, and leadership skills. These mentors
work closely together and learn from each other while inspiring the students.
