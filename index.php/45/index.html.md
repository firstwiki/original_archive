## History

The TechnoKats Robotics Team [(technokats.org)](http://www.technokats.org "http://www.technokats.org") competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition [(usfirst.org)](http://www.usfirst.org "http://www.usfirst.org") as "team 45".

FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) focuses on inspiring students in math, science, and technology fields through sponsoring a nationwide robotics competition. Many students and adults get very excited about competing in this challenging and fun atmosphere.

The 2006-2007 season is the sixteenth year for the TechnoKats and FIRST. In 1992, the Delco Electronics - Kokomo/Center Schools partnership was one of 28 teams to compete in the inaugural FIRST Competition. Since then, FIRST has grown to include over 1000 teams in numerous countries. During this time, the team's partnership has also grown. Over the years, Delco became a division of Delphi, Ivy Tech became a TechnoKat supporting partner, and the TechnoKats have made a name for themselves in Howard County and the FIRST community.

We are proud of our history. We have a strong tradition of competing at a high level in FIRST while also being a model team in showing "gracious professionalism" as we compete. We have mentored many teams, both in Indiana and across North America. These teams and others in the FIRST community look to the TechnoKats as a model FIRST team. We continually strive to uphold that model for how a FIRST team should be organized and how they should compete.

During these many years, the team has been led by the partnership between Delphi and the Kokomo Center School Corporation. KACC teacher Tim Railey has served as team leader from the high school side of the partnership for 12 of those 13 years, and he was even involved during the first season in '92\. The success and stability of the team is a direct result of the strong partnership between Delphi-D and KCSC, and to the dedication of Tim. There has been much engineering leadership from Delphi during these years also. Various engineers have led the team, while Andy Baker has served as the engineering team leader since 2000.

Many students have been TechnoKats. Many have gone on to work as engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs in various fields. We have alumni working in the automotive industry, for companies like Delphi and GM. Other alumni work in aerospace, information technology, consumer electronics, and healthcare. We are sure that being a TechnoKat played a big role in their success today.

## Accomplishments

**This Accomplishments section needs to be split into separate articles.**<br>
This section should be for a few Major accomplishments that deserve to be highlighted.<br>
Additional accomplishments should be moved to the appropriate Team/Year page. See [FIRSTwiki:Page formats](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page

## formats" ) for more help.

The TechnoKats have received these awards over the years:

===1992=== National Competition Finalist, Ultimate Keeper Award

===1994=== Chairman's Award Finalist

===1995=== Chairman's Award Finalist

===1998=== National Competition Champion, National "Technical Excellence" Award, Great Lakes Regional Runner-Up, Great Lakes Regional "Best Play" Award

===1999=== National Competition Runner-Up, Midwest Regional "Outstanding Defense"

===2000=== National "Xerox Creativity" Award, Midwest Regional Champion, Great Lakes Regional Runner-Up, Kettering University Scholarship: $20k, Vinny Cothern

===2001=== National Competition #1 Seed & Finalist, Midwest Regional GM Industrial Design Award & Finalist, W. Michigan Regional Leadership in Controls Award & Division Semi-finalist, Kettering University Scholarship: $20k, Philip Lundberg

===2007=== St. Louis Regional Champion, St. Louis Regional Motorola Quality Award, Boilermaker Regional Motorola Quality Award, Championship Galileo Division Quarterfinalist

More important than getting awards, students are getting inspired. Many TechnoKat alumni are pursuing science and engineering majors at prominent universities, while many have begun technical careers in the workforce. This is proof that FIRST is inspiring and that being a TechnoKat is rewarding. Along with students getting inspired, engineers and teachers are having fun while sharpening their design, teaching, and leadership skills. These mentors work closely together and learn from each other while inspiring the students.
