##  Content Provided As-Is

Accuracy is striven for, but not guaranteed. Edit if you find a problem. Use
at your own risk.

##  Lack of Responsibility for Content

This wiki is not created by [FIRST](http://www.usfirst.org
"http://www.usfirst.org" ) (that is the official website, the unofficial
article is [here](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" )) or any team within it. FIRST is
therefore not responsible for content contained within this wiki.

Although [ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" ) hosts this site,
it is not responsible for the content.
[Administrators](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Administrators
"FIRSTwiki:Administrators" ) are not responsible for content (except for that
which was written by them). Authors are responsible for all of their own
content.

By using this site, you agree to never hold FIRSTwiki, ChiefDelphi, the
[Administrators](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Administrators
"FIRSTwiki:Administrators" ) and any other affiliates and authors responsible
for the site's content.

##  Use at Own Risk
