[Dave Lavery](Dave_Lavery "Dave Lavery") is rarely in his office, if you spot him on the webcam, report it here. Eventually Dave will find this and be thoroughly unnerved. :-)

- Jun 2004 (EDT) 11:20: Just saw him, he was reading some sort of document. Looked like he was acually doing work.
- 11:20 PM 02 June 2004: Looking at papers on desk towards cam.
- 12:32 PM 02 June 2004: Typing at computer.
- 02:16 PM 02 June 2004: Clicking left mouse button and pressing ESC or TAB on keyboard
- 02:36 PM 02 June 2004: Sitting with Right leg over left with hands folded on lap looking at blue folder
- 03:00 PM 02 June 2004: Hmmm... He's got some sort of weird multicolor oragami in front of him
- 04:16 PM 02 June 2004: Leaning over and looking at phone. (?)
- 04:29 PM 02 June 2004: Dave has good posture :-)
- 04:40 PM 02 June 2004: Dave is reaching under his desk right arm. Looking at a picture on his blue folder.
- 10:48 AM 09 June 2004: Dave is clicking his mouse with his right hand while looking at screen. Left arm is resting on desk.
- 04:17 PM 02 July 2004: On the computer.
- 01:17 PM 12 July 2004: On the computer, wearing a getup eerily similar to that "younger Dave" picture.
- 02:21 PM 14 July 2004: On the computer, possibly responding to an email I'd sent him.
- 03:33 PM 05 August 2004: On his computer, wearing one of those little black ties.
- 11:41 AM 06 August 2004: Dave standing by chair, looking like he's thinking about work. (Work, Dave, work!)
- 08:41 AM 09 August 2004: On his computer (surprise, surprise). Looks like he's wearing a Star Wars tie from the angle--we'll find out later today.
- 02:53 PM 11 August 2004: On the computer (again).
- 02:57 PM 11 August 2004: Shimmying the keyboard to the right with his left hand, clicking with the other.
- 03:01 PM 11 August 2004: Now done shimmying the keyboard, his left hand is on his lap. The right hand, however, is still fused to the mouse
- 03:05 PM 11 August 2004: Typing with one hand, clicking with the other.
- 04:29 PM 24 August 2004: On the computer...again. (If it weren't for the times I've seen the office sans Dave, I'd swear he was attached to that computer.)
- 11:29 AM 25 August 2004: On the computer. Different shirt from yesterday, so I presume he does go home eventually. (Just kidding...we all know Dave has to leave the office.)
- 01:27 PM 26 August 2004: Talking to someone off-screen and gesturing.
- 01:37 PM 26 August 2004: Looking at some kind of catalog. Shopping for FIRST parts already?! :D (wait a second--he wasn't on his computer? he was using something...PAPER?! excuse me while I faint.)
- 03:21 PM 27 August 2004: On computer, white shirt, blackish tie.
- 10:01 AM 02 September 2004: Bent away from the camera, as though he's grabbing something from that stack of items back there.
- 04:21 PM 02 September 2004: Facing the exit to his office, looking with a weird grin at his coffee mug. It screams caption contest...but since I said caption contest, it won't happen.
- 02:21 PM 03 September 2004: Dave must be perky, since he's got a bright yellow shirt on today. And he's typing with two hands. I'm yet to see that before.
- 12:13 PM 07 September 2004: Bent over his desk, looking at either a magazine or a catalog, stroking his chin. Kit ordering again, Dave?
- 03:37 PM 07 September 2004: Facing his computer, holding some spherical object. Can't tell what. (Perhaps we should buy Dave a higher-res DaveCam for Kickoff?) 

  - Ha! Ha! Ha! Yeah, Dave in streaming HD! --[Phrontist](User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist") 08:58, 9 Sep 2004 (EDT)

- 10:37 AM 14 September 2004: Dave's hunched over his desk's corner, looks like he's either looking at a CD case or leering at the camera.
- 12:29 PM 20 September 2004: Wearing a blue checked shirt, on the computer. (Is this a continuation of the rebellion against his co-workers for the What Not to Wear plot?)
- 09:33 AM 22 September 2004: Back to the normal white shirts, head tilted down a bit while scratching his right ear with his left arm. Or something like that.
- 09:53 AM 23 September 2004: At the computer, leaning in to see something up close. VERY up close.
- 11:57 AM 24 September 2004: Absorbed in a document. Undoubtably a memo from the giant clue conspiracy.
- 08:53 AM 28 September 2004: Working on a picture frame, or so it appears.
- 10:57 AM 14 October 2004: Looking at yet another catalog. You really should keep the kit a better secret, Dave. (grin)
- 02:17 PM 14 October 2004: On the phone, looking serious. First the Church medal, now an Oscar!
- 09:29 AM 28 October 2004: At the computer, wearing a black shirt and (perhaps) an orange tie. Halloween at NASA. Rock, rock on.
- 12:57 PM 29 October 2004: At the computer again. He must go through keyboards like Kleenex.
- 11:10 AM 30 November 2004: Hunched over some book.
- 04:42 PM 30 November 2004: Leaning towards his phone, reaching for something beyond it. (by the way, nice cleaning job, Dave!)
- 04:58 PM 02 December 2004: Looks like he's reading a fortune cookie fortune. (So that's where he gets those hints!)
- 11:46 AM 07 December 2004: Reading another fortune cookie, this time in front of his computer.
- 03:38 PM 08 December 2004: Playing with some small dark-colored object on his desk.
- 03:47 PM 14 January 2005: On his computer
- 05:50 PM 20 April 2005: Team 772 saw him driving around the unloading area on a segway at the back of the pits in Atlanta.
- 12:27 PM 17 May 2005: On the computer...again...
- 12:30 PM 26 July 2005: On computer, not sweating the dozen KKs from IRI a bit.
- 4:13 PM 20 September 2005: On the computer...typing something. Nice laptop. Is he writing code for 2006?
- 2:30 PM 31 October 2005: On his computer, really close to the screen I might add
- 10:45 AM 15 December 2005: On the computer (looks like EBay Holiday shopping. I'm thinking the flamingo is far more productive in that chair)

  11:09 AM 15 December 2005: Nope, Ebay is blocked by our firewall. I was finishing the field design for 2006\. Too bad you couldn't see it clearly! Hahahah! [Presumably from Dave]

- 21:20, 27 December 2005 (EST): It seems the server is now timing-out, so it's hard to see who's in his office.
- 21:16, 6 July 2007 (EDT): White image. Is the Amazing DaveCam down???

And now, for one non-Dave sighting...

- 03:05 PM 13 July 2004: Not dave, but someone's in his office!
