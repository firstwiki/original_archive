##  Synopsis

**It's not because the kids look up to him that [Dave] gets picked on, it's really because it's just so much fun. - Heidi Foster **

It is hard to try to sum him up. He's rather mysterious, and
[FIRSTers](/index.php/FIRSTer "FIRSTer" ) are always running into ancedotes
about him. Some think he is the Che Guevara of the [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ) revolution, at least in the fact that his face has turned into a
subcultural meme, forever associated with "[That's
Pimp](/index.php/That%27s_Pimp "That's Pimp" )." In the early nineties Dave
was a wholesome NASA engineer with a penchant for those little black ties NASA
loves so much. He looked like this, well at least when he was on grainy public
access:

  
In recent years we've seen the development of a newer, more edgy Dave, focus
group tested to be "down" with today's youth.

The key to Dave's Office:

  * If Humphrey (a pink flamingo) is in my chair, it means I am on travel and not in the office today. 
  * If I am in my chair, it means I am not on travel and am in the office today. 
  * If I am not in my chair, and Humphrey is not in my chair, it means I am lost and probably wandering the halls looking for my office.

##  Dave Work Poem- By Dave Lavery

This is Dave's office  
This is where Dave works  
Work, Dave, work!  
  
Do you see Dave?  
Is he working?  
If Dave is not here,  
then he is working somewhere else  
Work, Dave, work!  
  
Do you see Opus?  
Opus is a penguin.  
From the Antarctic.  
Penguins don't work (much).  
Don't work, Opus, don't work!  
  
Do you see Humphrey?  
Humphrey is a flamingo  
He doesn't work either  
Don't work, Humphrey, don't work!  
  
Humphrey and Opus help Dave work  
by answering most of his e-mail.  
But they can't really help much  
because their feathers keep  
getting stuck in the keyboard.  
That is why most of Dave's messages  
look like this:
