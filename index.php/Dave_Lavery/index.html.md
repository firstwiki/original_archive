## Synopsis

**It's not because the kids look up to him that [Dave] gets picked on, it's really because it's just so much fun. - Heidi Foster**

It is hard to try to sum him up. He's rather mysterious, and [FIRSTers](FIRSTer "FIRSTer") are always running into ancedotes about him. Some think he is the Che Guevara of the [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST") revolution, at least in the fact that his face has turned into a subcultural meme, forever associated with "[That's Pimp](That%27s_Pimp "That's Pimp")." In the early nineties Dave was a wholesome NASA engineer with a penchant for those little black ties NASA loves so much. He looked like this, well at least when he was on grainy public access:

In recent years we've seen the development of a newer, more edgy Dave, focus group tested to be "down" with today's youth.

The key to Dave's Office:

- If Humphrey (a pink flamingo) is in my chair, it means I am on travel and not in the office today.
- If I am in my chair, it means I am not on travel and am in the office today.
- If I am not in my chair, and Humphrey is not in my chair, it means I am lost and probably wandering the halls looking for my office.

## Dave Work Poem- By Dave Lavery

This is Dave's office<br>
This is where Dave works<br>
Work, Dave, work!

Do you see Dave?<br>
Is he working?<br>
If Dave is not here,<br>
then he is working somewhere else<br>
Work, Dave, work!

Do you see Opus?<br>
Opus is a penguin.<br>
From the Antarctic.<br>
Penguins don't work (much).<br>
Don't work, Opus, don't work!

Do you see Humphrey?<br>
Humphrey is a flamingo<br>
He doesn't work either<br>
Don't work, Humphrey, don't work!

Humphrey and Opus help Dave work<br>
by answering most of his e-mail.<br>
But they can't really help much<br>
because their feathers keep<br>
getting stuck in the keyboard.<br>
That is why most of Dave's messages<br>
look like this:
