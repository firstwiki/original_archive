# CoreChart

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**CoreChart** was an icon-based development tool similar to RoboLab or the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, except that it encouraged a more in-depth understanding of the internals of the controller. It was produced by eLabtronics.

A special version was available for [FIRST](first) [teams](Team "Team"), CoreChartFR, which included support for [Innovation First](Innovation_First%2C_Inc. "Innovation First,
Inc.")'s libraries and the [IFI Loader](IFI_Loader "IFI Loader").

## Code

CoreChart worked at the [assembly](Assembly "Assembly") level, meaning its blocks represented individual machine instructions rather than simple to understand high level commands. It included none of the abstraction of [PIC C](PIC_C "PIC C"), such as function arguments or data types, a factor which led to its non-adoption and subsequent downfall.

## Program

CoreChart itself was written in [Visual Basic](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic "wikipedia:Visual_Basic"). It called [Microchip](Microchip "Microchip")'s assembler and linker (which was included in the installer) to generate a hex file.
