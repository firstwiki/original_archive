# CoreChart

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**CoreChart** was an icon-based development tool similar to RoboLab or the Lego Mindstorms Robotics Invention System, except that it encouraged a more in-depth understanding of the internals of the controller. It was produced by eLabtronics. 

A special version was available for [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" )
[teams](Team "Team" ), CoreChartFR, which included support for
[Innovation First](Innovation_First%2C_Inc. "Innovation First,
Inc." )'s libraries and the [IFI Loader](IFI_Loader "IFI Loader" ).


##  Code

CoreChart worked at the [assembly](Assembly "Assembly" ) level,
meaning its blocks represented individual machine instructions rather than
simple to understand high level commands. It included none of the abstraction
of [PIC C](PIC_C "PIC C" ), such as function arguments or data
types, a factor which led to its non-adoption and subsequent downfall.


##  Program

CoreChart itself was written in [Visual
Basic](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic "wikipedia:Visual_Basic" ).
It called [Microchip](Microchip "Microchip" )'s assembler and
linker (which was included in the installer) to generate a hex file.
