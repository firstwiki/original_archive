# Template talk:Feature

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Why'd you remove the title for the feature? The featured articles is
"Resources for C programming," not "C programming." When first looking at the
paragraph, it seems like its talking about programming in general, not the
article itself.--[SilverStar (Advay)](/index.php/User:SilverStar

    Hrm... I started a discussion about this I thought, but can't seem to locate it. I did comment my edit, though, by saying that it looks better without the header and I referred to wikipedia, which does not include it. Perhaps the article could be re-worded, and the bolded text needed to be a link to the article ... but I don't think a header like this is the fix we need. See how it is done with the current feature, PBASIC. The header is, IMO, aesthetically unpleasing and quite unnecessary. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:59, 17 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Oh, yes. I found where I put the discussion -- I thought you'd have seen it! [User talk:SilverStar](/index.php/User_talk:SilverStar "User talk:SilverStar" ). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 12:07, 18 Jun 2004 (EDT)

##  Who decides?

Who decides what should the next featured article be?

    Very good question. We are discussing this currently at [FIRSTwiki:Community decisions](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Community_decisions "FIRSTwiki:Community decisions" ), and would like your input. To suggest an article, though, or to comment on a suggested article, please see [FIRSTwiki:Featured article candidates](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Featured_article_candidates "FIRSTwiki:Featured article candidates" ). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:59, 17 Jun 2004 (EDT)

##  Hello

I put up a featured article to test the new format of the main page because
there was nothing there and there has been no activity on this site for _2
years_. If anyone has a problem, please let me know or don't hesitate to
change it. - [Hollis1138](/index.php/User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" )

##  Featured Article Changeup

I got a little tired of seeing that one article being featured forever so I
took a look at the [FIRSTwiki:Featured article
candidates](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Featured_article_candidates
"FIRSTwiki:Featured article candidates" ) page and just took the one on the
top of the list and put it on. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000
