The [FLL Challenge](/index.php/FLL_Challenge "FLL Challenge" ) theme for 2004
was No Limits. FLL teams were tasked to compete in the Robot Game, as well
complete a Project to research how science and technology can make our world a
world of NO Limits to those with disabilities.

The challenge was released in September, 2004 with the bulk of Official State
tournaments occuring in December. The season was concluded by the [FLL World
Festival](/index.php/FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival" ) which was held
in conjunction with the FIRST Championship event in April 2005. Over 45,000
kids from 20 countries participated in this FLL season.

Teams were introduced to this year's theme with a story - Late for Lunch -
which described the day in a life of a child with a disability. Teams were
then asked to compete in the Robot Game, and design and present a Research
Project.

Game" )]

## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of
Lego on it related to that year's theme. Examples included: Setting a table of
food; Retrieving a pair of glasses; Playing basketball; etc. All everyday
activities that someone without disabilities might take for granted. In the
robot game, a robot designed by the team and built entirely from Lego
Mindstorms kits and Lego pieces had to autonomously complete the missions on
the board. Each mission has a specific point value.

## The Project

The Research Project for No Limits asked teams to...

  * Be Detectives: Find a public place and examine it for challenges that might be faced by someone with a disability 
  * Be Inventors: Teams had to design and propose an invention that would make it easier for someone with a disability to overcome a problem in the location selected 
  * Be Marketing Experts: Raise awareness in the community about the problem and the team's proposed solution/invention
