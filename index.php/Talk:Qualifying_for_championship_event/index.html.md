TODO:

Update page based on new qualification information. Maybe this should be a
yearly page, e.g., Qualifications (2005)? Either way, here are some links to

  * [FIRST page giving eligibility rules](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/2005/cmp_elig.htm "http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/2005/cmp_elig.htm" )
  * [CD discussion on said rules](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=29003 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=29003" )
