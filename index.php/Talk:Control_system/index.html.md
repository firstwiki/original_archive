What high-tech parts need to be added???

    I thought that's what you said. I misread it. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" )

Shouldn't things like PID loops be under programming?

    It can be in both places - adding links now. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 19:05, 29 May 2004 (EDT) 

    damn, lost my edit... anyway, like SilverStar said, it can be linked to from both. It isn't inherently part of programming. In fact, if anything it belongs in control system and not programming because the concepts are probably older than programming and probably the majority of PID loops you encounter nowadays aren't even digitally implemented. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:08, 29 May 2004 (EDT) 

  
a gyro is an accelerometer, correct? (Of course there are non-gyro
accelerometers...) --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:11, 29 May 2004

    Yes, and yes. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 19:11, 29 May 2004 (EDT) 

Can you move the TOC to the right? Or is that to much an opinion?
