Okay, so.... wow. This is really cool, no? But it's all so much at once... how
am I ever going to figure this out? Don't worry, FIRSTwiki can provide you
with everything you need to know, and if can't, it will point you to
sites/people who can.

Welcome to the Hitchhikers Guide to FIRST Robotics. This guide will serve as a
panoramic introduction to the world of FIRST robotics in all aspects,
providing links to more in depth articles.

### What is it?

The name FIRST is an acronym, which translates to: **F**or **I**nspiration and
**R**ecognition of **S**cience and **T**echnology. Taken from the offical US
FIRST website: "FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
Technology) is a multinational non-profit organization, that aspires to
transform culture, making science, math, engineering, and technology as cool
for kids as sports are today.

FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway Human
Transporter. FIRST operates the FIRST Robotics Competition in which teams of
high school students, sponsored and assisted by local companies and
volunteers, design, assemble, and test a robot capable of performing a
specified task in competition with other teams. FIRST also runs the FIRST LEGO
League, for children 9-14 years old, and FIRST Place, an innovative science
and technology center, including a hands-on children's science museum."

## The Robot Guide

ion=8 "Edit section: Robot Mechanics" )]

### Robot Mechanics

The best way to get started is to get out the good ol' [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) (KoP) and see what you can
piece together. Since 2003 the KoP has provided enough parts to piece together
a fully operational [two wheel
drive](/index.php?title=Two_wheel_drive&action=edit "Two wheel drive" )
drivetrain. The first important thing your robot should do is drive, since you
can't compete if your robot cannot drive around sucessfully. Getting aquainted
with and building a simple [drive train](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train"
) will set you on the right path to a successful robot.  
The scoring mechanism is another important feature: your robot should have one
if you plan on playing offense. Every year the FIRST competition varies, so
design your mechanism to what you believe will work most effectively for the
current game.  
If you're just looking for a simple answer, the most important thing your
robot must do is work. =)

#### Motors

[Motors](/index.php/Motor "Motor" ) translate electrical energy into
rotational mechanical energy. These are the primary sources of mechanical
energy for your robot.

_**2008 KIP Motors:**_  
[Chiaphua/CIM](/index.php/CIM_motor "CIM motor" ) | [Denso
Window](/index.php/Denso_window_motor "Denso window motor" ) | [Taigene
Window](/index.php?title=Taigene_window_motor&action=edit "Taigene window
motor" ) | [Keyang](/index.php?title=Keyang_motor&action=edit "Keyang motor" )

motor" ), [RS-550](/index.php/RS-550_Banebots_motor "RS-550 Banebots motor" ))

[[edit](/index.php?title=The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_To_Robotics&action=edit&sect
ion=10 "Edit section: Transmissions" )]

#### Transmissions

If you were to just slap a wheel on to one of the higher powered motors, your
robot would have an incredible top speed and not enough torque to move. To
solve this, you'd incorperate some type of speed reduction. Since speed and
torque are proportional, as you "gear down" your speed, your torque increases.
A transmission is what you would use to achieve this type of reduction.
Transmissions come in all sorts of flavors: starting from the [kit
transmission](/index.php?title=Kit_transmission&action=edit "Kit transmission"
), to a multiple motor transmission, to a shifting transmission, to a multiple
motor shifting transmission, to a [Continuously Variable
Transmission](/index.php/CVT "CVT" ), and so forth! There are many ways to
build a transmission, but the trick is to pick and design the right one to
complement your robots functions as well as stay within your team's resources
(money and machining capability). To explore more on the topic of
transmissions, follow [this link](/index.php/Transmission "Transmission" ).

ion=11 "Edit section: Robot Electronics" )]

### Robot Electronics

Electronics are the internal guts to your robot. In short they are what power
and control your robot's electrical components (motors, lights, etc). The [kit
of parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) (KoP) will provide you with
enough [electronics](/index.php/Electronics_and_circuitry "Electronics and
circuitry" ) to get the KoP robot to drive, minus a few wires and connectors.
The combination of the Robot Controller, Victor speed controllers, and Spike
relay modules control all the actions of the robot. The [Robot
Controller](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ) (RC), normally
with the addition of sensors, controls the robot during the autonomous mode of
the competition.

ion=12 "Edit section: Programming" )]

### Programming

Programming is like the link that ties electronics and mechanics together.
With programming, you tell the robot what to do when it is presented with a
condition/situation, and how to react to that situation (i.e. push the
joystick forward, the robot goes forward). As of 2005, the current programming
language is C. You can read more about programming in [this how-to
article](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ).
