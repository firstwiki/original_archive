A note on style: when everything is in bold, it is hard to know what **specifically** to focus in on. Using bold is a good tool to give the reader certain visual clues ... but when the visual senses are overloaded, what is the point? If the purpose is to narrow a reader's focus in on something specific, but the entire page is emboldened, does this not represent a contradiction? This should probably find its way to the style guide ... but I wanted to make sure everyone sees my point. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 22:01, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)

You are definitley right, I think had originally planned to have other text underneath the headings or something... --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:06, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Where's/what's the free beer? ;) --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 15:17, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Well, apparently, getting access to commands in PATH variable folders, which was neccesary for images and math, gave me access to the "makebeer" command. Try "makebeer -heineken" --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:05, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
