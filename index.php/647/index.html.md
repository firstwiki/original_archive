## History

Team 647 The Cyber Wolves Corps was founded in 2001 by a group of interested students at Robert M. Shoemaker High school. With the support of teacher Michael Owens and the sponsorship of USAOTC, a FIRST team was born. The quality and the competitive ability of the team have been constantly improving. With the help of the dedicated mentors and students the team has managed to embody the principals of FIRST. All the hard work paid off when, with a team made up mostly of inexperienced freshmen, the team took 1st place at the Lone Star Regional in 2003.

The team remains dedicated to educating and inspiring as the primary goals of the program and are participating in many community outreach programs. While participating in these programs the students are able to ensure that a fresh crop of young adults will be inspired to reach for the stars.
