##  API Information

The Blue Alliance has essentially a complete database of team information,
event information, and match results for the FIRST Robotics Competition. We
have found our database tremendously useful in developing our Match Video
Archives, but we bet that you can come up with something just as great to do
with this information.

The TBA API is currently implemented in several different languages, including
PHP, .NET, and Ruby. However, since the API relies on standard XML, it can be
integrated into almost any application. To see a list of currently available
API packages, browse our API directory.

For full documentation of the API, read [the documentation
PDF](http://www.thebluealliance.net/tbatv/api/apidocs.pdf
"http://www.thebluealliance.net/tbatv/api/apidocs.pdf" ). In order to use the
TBA API, you will need an API Key. Instructions on how to request one are in
the API docs.


##  Get an API Key

##  Finding EventIDs

Since TBA changed its URLs to be prettier (/event/2009ct/), eventids are no
longer visable to users of the system. To find an event's eventid, use this
