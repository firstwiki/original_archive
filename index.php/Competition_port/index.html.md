The competition port is on the top of the [operator
interface](/index.php/Operator_interface "Operator interface" ) and interfaces
with [FIRST's](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) hardware at competitions. It is used
by FIRST to turn robots on, off, and initate [autonomous
mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ) at competitions. The port
is only used at competitions, and when using a
[dongle](/index.php/Competition_port_dongle "Competition port dongle" ).
