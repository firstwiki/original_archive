Amanda Morrison started in the 2002 season as a high school senior on Team
#71, Team Hammond. After graduation, she went to Ball State University to
study English. There, she joined budding Team #1020 as a college mentor.
During this time, she became active on the ChiefDelphi forums and became a

Amanda also serves as Secretary for the IndianaFIRST Board of Directors, and
is on Planning Committees for both the Boilermaker Regional and the Indiana

reformed and is now #1720, Muncie/Delaware Robotics (for more information,

Amanda is reachable via the ChiefDelphi forums.
