This person is an [Unsung FIRST Hero](/index.php/Unsung_FIRST_Hero "Unsung
FIRST Hero" ).

Amanda Morrison started in the 2002 season as a high school senior on Team
#71, Team Hammond. After graduation, she went to Ball State University to
study English. There, she joined budding Team #1020 as a college mentor.
During this time, she became active on the ChiefDelphi forums and became a
moderator. Shortly thereafter, she joined with fellow #71 alumna Amanda
Aldridge and #461 student, Josh Hambright, to create the Unsung FIRST Heroes
Award on ChiefDelphi.com.

Amanda also serves as Secretary for the IndianaFIRST Board of Directors, and
is on Planning Committees for both the Boilermaker Regional and the Indiana
Robotics Invitational. Although Team #1020 folded in early 2005, the team has
reformed and is now #1720, Muncie/Delaware Robotics (for more information,
please see <http://www.muncierobotics.org>).

Amanda is reachable via the ChiefDelphi forums.
