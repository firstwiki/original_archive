### From FIRSTwiki

Shame, shame. Your own team page [122](122 "122" ) and you can't
even keep it in proper format, forget filled with content? What kind of Admin
are you :p Btw, noticed a strange bug, the [user:team page
bot](User:Team_page_bot "User:Team page bot" ) seems to have
disappeared! Look at the history of your page and nearly every other team page
bot page. Look at [its contrbutions](http://www.firstwiki.org/index.php?title=
Special:Contributions&target=Team_page_bot "http://www.firstwiki.org/index.php
?title=Special:Contributions&target=Team_page_bot" )]. Strange. Seems like
anything not edited before a certain date lost team page bot from its
history... --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:00, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    Eh, I'm no longer an "official" team member. The team is at a big transition point right now, and I would have to hold my tongue about certain things I might mention. About the strange occurrence, I also noticed that a few of my edits dissapeared around the time of updating to the new version of MediaWiki (not the content, but the notice in the history page). I looked, and it happened to a few other people's edits that I noticed, but I can't offer any "hard proof" of the matter, and I don't know that it's necessarily a big issue, so much as a one time glitch that didn't affect the actual content. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:04, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    That I'm aware of and I apologize for an error on my part when upgrading. This is different though, it's from a long time ago. And I think I even recall looking at team page bot's contributions earlier and seeing all 800+ before. Well as long as it doesn't keep happening... --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:13, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Thanks for improving my crappy instructions on
[User_talk:24.147.180.61](User_talk:24.147.180.61 "User
talk:24.147.180.61" ). To my credit, I was kinda in a rush, but I guess i
shouldn't post anything if it is half-done and probably not that helpful to a
new user. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 14:36, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Since when was copyright stuff and official don't-use-this-phrase the wave of
the future? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303

    You must not read [slashdot](http://slashdot.org "http://slashdot.org" )? ;) Seriously, though ... I believe I was referring to the term 'Robovation' being the wave of the future, as opposed to 'EDUrobotics' or 'EDU Bot.' FIRST can no longer use that phrase to describe thier 'Robovation' kit ... and it discourages us from using it in relation to 'Robovation.' I merely stipulate that if this is what FIRST is using, it is more appropriate for us to use in an encyclopedia of sorts about FIRST. If some new FIRSTer hears the term 'Robovation' he won't have any inclination to come here and search for 'EDU Bot.' --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 21:34, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT)
