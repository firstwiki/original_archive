# FIRSTwiki:FIRST LEGO league qualifying tournament page format

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

_This is an [FIRSTwiki Official Page Format](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats
"FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ). Please use it when appropriate._

Use this page format to create a page for an official qualifying Tournament.
Usually, the top performing teams at a qualifying tournament will qualify for
the state tournament as per that state's procedures.

_You can insert this by placing {{subst:format/Fllqualifyingevent}}, and
saving._

We Suggest that you add [[Category:FLL Location Tournaments]] where Location
is your state (ex [[Category:FLL New York Tournaments]] if you were creating a
New York tournament.

A working example can be found at
[CT_Enfield_Tournament](CT_Enfield_Tournament "CT Enfield
Tournament" ).
