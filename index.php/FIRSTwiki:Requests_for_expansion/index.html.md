# FIRSTwiki:Requests for expansion

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Almost every article in FIRSTwiki could do with some expansion - the aim of [FIRSTwiki](FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki") is to have every article at featured status. This page is for listing those articles of any length for which there is a specific request or longer (non-stub) articles which are still embarrassingly short or insufficient for an encyclopedia of the stature to which Wikipedia aspires.

Articles to list here:

- Articles in the [Category:Articles to be expanded](Category:Articles_to_be_expanded "Category:Articles to be expanded") page.
- [Stubs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stub "wikipedia:Stub") - Articles that are very short. Since stubs by definition are tagged as being too short for their subject, they should be added to the list accompanied by a brief explanation of what needs to be done. A list of current Stub articles can be found here: [Category:Stubs](Category:Stubs "Category:Stubs")
- Longer articles that still need expansion.
- Articles with the [Template:Expand](Template:Expand "Template:Expand") tag on them.

Articles not to list here:

- Articles only needing an image
- Articles that do not yet exist - Use [FIRSTwiki:Requested articles](FIRSTwiki:Requested_articles "FIRSTwiki:Requested articles") instead.
- Articles that need fixing - Use [FIRSTwiki:Cleanup](FIRSTwiki:Cleanup "FIRSTwiki:Cleanup") instead.

## How to add a new listing

Please list entries chronologically (newest at top), **with a note about what needs to be expanded.** On this page, be sure to sign your post with ~~~~ so the date will be included. Please also bold the title of the article you are adding, to make the list easier to read.

## 2007

Please place new requests at the **top** of the appropriate list and make the article link **bold**. Please remember to sign with four tildes (~~~~).

- **[Team Info](Team_Info "Team Info")** - Please help add more information to this page. The idea behind the page is great but it needs work. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000") 13:15, 14 May 2007 (EDT)
- **[Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award](Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_%26_Byers_Entrepreneurship_Award "Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award")** - Moved from the Requested articles as the article exists but contains little content. Please Expand. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000") 14:00, 29 May 2007 (EDT)
- **[Website Design Award](Website_Design_Award "Website Design Award")** - Moved from the Requested articles as the article exists but contains little content. Please Expand. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000") 14:00, 29 May 2007 (EDT)
