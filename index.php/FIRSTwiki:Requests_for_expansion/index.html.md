# FIRSTwiki:Requests for expansion

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Almost every article in FIRSTwiki could do with some expansion - the aim of
[FIRSTwiki](/index.php/FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki" ) is to have every article at
featured status. This page is for listing those articles of any length for
which there is a specific request or longer (non-stub) articles which are
still embarrassingly short or insufficient for an encyclopedia of the stature
to which Wikipedia aspires.

Articles to list here:

  * Articles in the [Category:Articles to be expanded](/index.php/Category:Articles_to_be_expanded "Category:Articles to be expanded" ) page. 
  * [Stubs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stub "wikipedia:Stub" ) \- Articles that are very short. Since stubs by definition are tagged as being too short for their subject, they should be added to the list accompanied by a brief explanation of what needs to be done. A list of current Stub articles can be found here: [Category:Stubs](/index.php/Category:Stubs "Category:Stubs" )
  * Longer articles that still need expansion. 
  * Articles with the [Template:Expand](/index.php/Template:Expand "Template:Expand" ) tag on them. 

  
Articles not to list here:

  * Articles only needing an image 
  * Articles that do not yet exist - Use [FIRSTwiki:Requested articles](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Requested_articles "FIRSTwiki:Requested articles" ) instead. 
  * Articles that need fixing - Use [FIRSTwiki:Cleanup](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Cleanup "FIRSTwiki:Cleanup" ) instead. 

  


## How to add a new listing

Please list entries chronologically (newest at top), **with a note about what
needs to be expanded.** On this page, be sure to sign your post with ~~~~ so
the date will be included. Please also bold the title of the article you are
adding, to make the list easier to read.

  


## 2007

Please place new requests at the **top** of the appropriate list and make the
article link **bold**. Please remember to sign with four tildes (~~~~).

  

  * **[Team Info](/index.php/Team_Info "Team Info" )** \- Please help add more information to this page. The idea behind the page is great but it needs work. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 13:15, 14 May 2007 (EDT) 
  * **[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award](/index.php/Kleiner_Perkins_Caufield_%26_Byers_Entrepreneurship_Award "Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award" )** \- Moved from the Requested articles as the article exists but contains little content. Please Expand. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 14:00, 29 May 2007 (EDT) 
  * **[Website Design Award](/index.php/Website_Design_Award "Website Design Award" )** \- Moved from the Requested articles as the article exists but contains little content. Please Expand. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 14:00, 29 May 2007 (EDT)
