Since I know no one looks at the discussion page, I have to put this here. I would like to know who wrote this article, please tell me in the discussion page. This is a good article, and it provides a good description of the machine. -Dan Morse

## Dirty Bird 2006

The 2006 robot is a "dumper"-- that is, it has the ability to score a large amount of balls in the lower goals of the field. It does not have the ability to shoot for the upper goal. It can be top-loaded (easily) by the human player, or it can pick up stray balls on the floor using an efficient conveyor system. DB2K6 can hold upwards of 40 balls-- in other words, as much or more than one could acquire in two minutes.<br>
The defining feature of DB2K6 (better known as "The Devil's Shopping Cart") is its drivetrain: it runs on four omniwheels placed at 45-degree angles to the frame. This gives the robot the ability to move in any direction while keeping its orientation, like a hovercraft. It is also very agile, allowing it to out- maneuver most opponents. Unfortunately, this setup allows for only average speed and little power (it can't push other robots around; however, it can lock other robots in place in a shoving match). Nevertheless, the benefits of agility and quickness outweigh the aforementioned downsides, as was shown in the Boston, MA regional where the Dirty Birds took 2nd place.<br>
DB2K6 has several autonomous modes: in mode one (first position), it can drive straight forward and dump 10 balls in the corner goal. In mode two (second position), it can drive across the field and dump 10 balls in the opposite corner goal. In mode three (third position), it can drive backwards to be loaded by the human player, or it can drive across the field to play autonomous "defense."
