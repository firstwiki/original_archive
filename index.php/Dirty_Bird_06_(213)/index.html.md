## Dirty Bird 2006

The 2006 robot is a "dumper"-- that is, it has the ability to score a large
amount of balls in the lower goals of the field. It does not have the ability
to shoot for the upper goal. It can be top-loaded (easily) by the human
player, or it can pick up stray balls on the floor using an efficient conveyor
system. DB2K6 can hold upwards of 40 balls-- in other words, as much or more
than one could acquire in two minutes.  
The defining feature of DB2K6 (better known as "The Devil's Shopping Cart") is
its drivetrain: it runs on four omniwheels placed at 45-degree angles to the
frame. This gives the robot the ability to move in any direction while keeping
its orientation, like a hovercraft. It is also very agile, allowing it to out-
maneuver most opponents. Unfortunately, this setup allows for only average
speed and little power (it can't push other robots around; however, it can
lock other robots in place in a shoving match). Nevertheless, the benefits of
agility and quickness outweigh the aforementioned downsides, as was shown in
the Boston, MA regional where the Dirty Birds took 2nd place.  
DB2K6 has several autonomous modes: in mode one (first position), it can drive
straight forward and dump 10 balls in the corner goal. In mode two (second
position), it can drive across the field and dump 10 balls in the opposite
corner goal. In mode three (third position), it can drive backwards to be
loaded by the human player, or it can drive across the field to play
autonomous "defense."
