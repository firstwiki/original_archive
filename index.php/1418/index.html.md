## Current Team Projects

  * [Arcade Cabinet](/index.php/1418/Arcade "1418/Arcade" ) \- As of December 2006, the Arcade machine is up and running. It plays two games: Fair Use Man, and Thy Shiney Quest. It is set up in the theater lobby, and costs a quarter to play. Last seen in lobby, summer of 2007. Location currently unknown.

## History

Started in 2004 at George Mason High School. Though started as a small team,
with roughly 10 core members, many of whom did a lot of programming, they grew
quite a bit in the 2006 season. They now have approximately 25 members, who
would "rather be audacious and risk failure then mediocre and risk boredom."
Historically, this has meant coming face to face with failure quite
frequently, never finishing in the top half after seeding matches. Team 1418
attended the NASA/VCU regional in 2004 and 2005, but attended the Chesapeke
regional in 2006. Team 1418 will likely continue to attend the Chesapeke
regional. In 2005, they attended Capitol Clash at the NBC4 Digital Edge Expo
in Washington D.C. As of now, there are no rising seniors for the 2008
competition, so the upcoming robots will be bunk(Note: the 'Bunk-Bot' is the
highest ranking robot 1418 has ever built. Just FYI).

  * Starting in 2005, team 1418 has brought their robot to both the 3K fun run and the memorial day parade on Memorial Day in the City of Falls Church, VA.
