#  Synopsis

Arcade cabinet based around old Atari 2600. Controllers will be custom made,
as will the cabinet and control ciructry. Will include Pong, Dogfight, and
other classics. All measurements below are in meters and it would be roughly
75 centimeters across. Cregulating the usage of the machine based on time of
day would prevent students from, say, skipping class to play pong.
