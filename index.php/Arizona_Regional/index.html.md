##  History

The Arizona Regional competition is an FRC competition that started in the
2003 season. It was founded by Microchip Technology Inc. and Microchip's
President &amp; CEO, Steve Sanghi. Historically it is held in the 2nd week of
regionals, around March 10.

The Arizona Regional is usually a medium sized regional, with attendance
numbers being around 40 teams in 2004, 28 teams in 2005, 45 in 2006, and 35
for 2007. The regional usually enjoys a variety of out of state teams (varying
from California to Alaska), and has enjoyed international teams from Canada
and Mexico (to date, it is the only regional to have a team from Mexico, team
1401, in attendance).


##  Location

The Arizona Regional competition is held at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum
(also known as the State Fair Grounds) in Phoenix, Arizona. For the most part
the Coliseum remains unused outside of State Fair time, though the Phoenix
Flame of the IBL are scheduled to start playing there in 2007. The arena is
usually split in half for competition, with the "front" half containing the
game field and the "back" half containing the pit area.

Due to the location (Arizona) and the large parking lot surrounding the
coliseum, it has become customary for a number of the teams in attendance to
pick up and eat their lunches out in the parking lot, so as not to violate the
contract of not bringing food into the venue. Many teams will socialize
outside in the nice weather, and team 1324 hosted a barbecue for all teams
outside in the 2006 season.


##  Team Social

The Arizona Regional has had a team social at the Arizona Science Center every
year since the Regional's inception. The team social is held on Friday night
of the competition, typically from about 6 PM to 9 PM. For the social teams
have access to all the normal exhibits in the Science Center, are able to
watch the planetarium presentations (including a roller coaster simulator),
and are able to eat a catered dinner for free. Teams have to give an advance
list to the Regional Planning Committee for tickets needed for the social, but
all tickets are free of charge.


##  Unique Awards

In addition to the normal Regional awards and scholarships, the Arizona
Regional also has two special awards it offers:

  * The Arizona Regional Teacher of the Year Award, which is awarded to a teacher of one of the teams attending the Arizona Regional. 
  * The Steve Sanghi Scholarship, which is a private scholarship awarded to a student on an Arizona FRC team.
