Is this the right place for Dave sightings? It seems like a page called Dave
Sightings would be better.

    Agreed, 199.46.200.232, I will do that when I get home. By the way, that's quite a unique name. (It's kind of pointless to sign a post as an anonymous uer unless you plan to be called 199.46.200.232) --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:10, 11 Aug 2004 (EDT) 

Anyone think of a good use for this: [http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/pictur

Well, You know more of him than I do!

It's hard not to hear about him --[Phrontist](User:Phrontist

    I'm not really sure whether or not this should be posted, odd as it is. I mean, it's not a Dave sighting. Ah well. --[Billfred](User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 11:07, 15 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

  

    Somehow, i know this is going to be one of the most frequently updated pages... All i have to say is "Oh my God" --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:47, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    Wow, I kind of started this as a joke, but maybe we should perpetuate it just to mess with Dave a bit --[Phrontist](User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) 16:31, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I think Dave actually goes to work!

I wonder if Dave is going to get those new 30" Cinema Displays....
