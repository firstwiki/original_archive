##  Process

At the annual Kickoff Event, every team receives a copy of Autodesk [3ds
max](3ds_max "3ds max" ) software and has approximately six weeks
to create their animation.

The animations are judged by other student animators. The animators usually
view the animations in a separate room and judge the other animations by
filling out a scoring sheet based on criteria defined by Autodesk. Winners of
the regional events advance to [The Championship
Event](The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event" ). At the
Championship level, the animations are judged by a panel of 3D graphics
experts, including Ted Boardman, and engineers associated with
[FIRST](first).

One winning entry is recognized at each regional competition, and the winners
proceed to be judged at the Championship. The Championship Autodesk
Visualization Award Winner, along with one Honorable Mention winner, is
announced during the award ceremony at the [The Championship
Event](The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event" ). The
Autodesk Visualization Rising Star Award is given to a team entering an
animation for their first year (not necessarily a rookie team), chosen from
all of the first-year animations. The Rising Star Award is only awarded at
[The Championship Event](The_Championship_Event "The Championship
Event" ). 984260371177

awards description](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/8-TheAwards-RevA-

"Edit section: Concept \(35%\)" )]

### Concept (35%)

"Judges will look for distinction in the use of design and animation to
illustrate and communicate a clearly defined message of what
[FIRST](first) means to your team. Your entry will be
measured in terms of how well your team identifies and executes on a concept
and organizes the content for your 30-second story. Also measured is how well
your animation follows your storyboard. Drawing from your team members, your
school and corporate partnership, your community involvement and/or your
robot, identify and illustrate a specific aspect of what
[FIRST](first) means to your team. Some examples of
appealing aspects of [FIRST](first): mentorship,
collaboration, leadership and/or community... your animation should be an
informative and clearly focused 30-second spot that supports your message of
what [FIRST](first) means to your team. Your entry will be
judged on how well your animation visually illustrates this written
statement."


### Creativity (35%)

"Judges will look for distinction in the use of design and animation to make
your entry visually exciting, ar striking and memorable. The challenge is to
create a compelling, creative and distinctive spot – one that stands out from
the rest. Think of what you are producing as being a 30-second “spot” that
might be intended for use on national television to inform viewers in an
exciting and creative way about [FIRST](first) and the
benefits of the [FIRST](first) experience."

### Technical Execution (30%)

"The challenge is to demonstrate how skillfully your team uses [3ds
max](3ds_max "3ds max" ) and other Autodesk products to create a
technically impressive animation. Your entry will be measured in terms of how
well your team uses all the features of [3ds max](3ds_max "3ds max"
) and other Autodesk products. Some examples of technical applications are:
modeling, materials application, lighting, camera motion and angles, sound
effects, texture mapping, color, special FX, character animation, editing
technique. In addition to using the features of [3ds max](3ds_max
"3ds max" ), judges will review how well you have incorporated elements such
as voice-over, music, photography, or live video into the animation."
