Chairman's Award Clock

The **Chairman’s Award** was created to keep the central focus of the [FIRST
Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ) as our ultimate goal for transforming the culture in ways that
will inspire greater levels of respect and honor for science and technology,
as well as encourage more of today’s youth to become scientists, engineers,
and technologists. The Chairman’s Award represents the spirit of
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). It honors the team that best represents a
model for other teams to emulate, which embodies the goals and purpose of
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). It remains the most prestigious team award
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) presents.

## History

Before 2002, the Chairman's Award was only given out at the National
Championship (now called "[The Championship
Event](/index.php/The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event" )"). Due to
the amount of entries received, and the quality of them,
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) wanted to recognize more for their
outstanding work in the community, while lightening the load of the judges. In
2002, a regional Chairman's Award was given out. Each team who wants to go for
the award must submit it at ONE regional event they are going to. Then those
teams in each regional go to a judging panel to present and have a questions
and answers session. In 2002 and before, Chairman's Award submissions could be
submitted as a video or other multimedia presentation; but in 2003 and after
teams were limited to only an essay for submission, but they could present a
video or other multimedia presentation during the presentation.

section: Procedure" )]

## Procedure

As of 2005, the judging process is as follows: a team has 5 minutes to present
what their team has done and achieved over the year/years without interruption
by the judges (usually 2, sometimes 3). Because of a strict time limit, if the
buzzer goes off in the middle of the presentation, they must move onto the
next part (the buzzer is usually an egg timer). After the presentation, the
team goes into a questions &amp; answers session with the judges, with judges
asking questions pertaining to anything presented in the presentation, team
involvement in changing their personal lives and aspirations, team
fundraising, and other questions. Since the Chairman's Award is separate from
the robot, specific technical questions about the robot are very rarely given.
