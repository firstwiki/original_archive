Use [Special:Upload](/index.php/Special:Upload "Special:Upload" ) to upload a
file. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 14:20, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    To use an image in an article, you might want to look at [Wikipedia:How to edit a page](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page#Links.2C_URLs.2C_images "wikipedia:Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page" ). It describes how you refer to the image. As [Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) said, though, please upload the file to the wiki -- it makes everything easier. If you have any questions, and you can't find any thing in our [help pages](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Help "FIRSTwiki:Help" ), you're more than welcome to ask it at [FIRSTwiki:User questions](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:User_questions "FIRSTwiki:User questions" ). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 14:33, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)
