## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

F.I.R.S.T., For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, was
founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen. The goal of F.I.R.S.T. is to inspire middle
school students and high school students to develop an interest in
mathematics, science and technology in a way that is fun and exciting. In
1992, the first ever F.I.R.S.T. robotics competition was held in Manchester,
New Hampshire with 28 teams participating. This year there will be a total of
more then 1000 teams participating at one or more of 30 regional events for
the possibility to compete in the championship event.

Our team is a group of 30 energetic and self-motivated Area High School and
University of Wisconsin – Platteville students and one of the only thirty
university/high school partnerships. We are gearing up for our 11th year in
the competition. Every high school student works with their own mentor from
the university working on the project. Our team has consisted of members from
almost every major offered at the university.

The main goal of the competition each year is to construct a robot from a kit
of parts and other materials within six weeks. Along with this, members of the
team work on animations of our robot, and public relations for the team. Also,
included is the Chairman’s Award which journals the partnership between the
high school and the sponsor. In the 1997 competition out team was named one of
four finalists of the coveted Chairman’s Award. At the 2002 competition, we
were an overall finalist and brought home the engineering inspiration award.
In 2003 we competed in and won the St. Louis regional, bringing home a great
looking trophy and respect from other teams. In the 2004 season we competed at
St. Louis and brought home third place medallions. Each year the F.I.R.S.T.
competition is televised on NASA and has had national and local coverage on
the nightly news and new documentaries on the Discovery Science Channel.

Our team’s goal for the future: bringing in more students from surrounding
area high schools, starting more teams in the Midwest, and promoting
sportsmanship, one of the key elements of the overall spirit of F.I.R.S.T.
whenever possible. We have taken our commitments to new levels by doing
numerous public appearances with our robots, past and present, such as
demonstrations for the UW-Board of Regents, UW-P Industrial Advisory Board,
Wisconsin State Fair, and local parades.
