##  Brief Introduction

The openFIRST Web Portal System is an integrated set of modules which may be
used together to create or enhance a web site. It is directed towards teams
participating in the FIRST competition. The software is written and maintained
by a group of students that are members of FIRST teams across the world. See
the [openFIRST Project site](http://www.openfirst.org
"http://www.openfirst.org" )


##  Mandate

(openFIRST is) an initiative designed to aid FIRST teams in creating their
team's web sites, and to provide quality feedback to webmasters of FIRST
teams. All of our original code is distributed under the GPL. Proprietary code
packaged with some modules may not be.

The openFIRST Project currently, and has in the past, participated a variety
of collaborative projects with other FIRST-Related Organisations. Those
wishing to propose such a collaborative project are invited to mail the
openfirst-devel mailing list.
