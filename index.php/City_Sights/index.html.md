The FLL Challenge theme for 2002 was City Sights. FLL teams were tasked to
compete in the Robot Game, as well complete a Research Assignment to design a
solution using robotics technology to a problem faced by a City of their
choice.

The challenge was released in September, 2002 with the bulk of Official State
tournaments occuring in December. The season was concluded by the [FLL
Invitational](FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival" ) (now known
as the FLL World Festival) which was held in conjunction with the FIRST
Championship event in April 2003.


## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of
Lego on it related to that year's theme. Examples included: Fixing a Bridge;
Collecting and Distributing Food; Cleaning up a Soccer Field; Cleaning up
Toxic Waste; etc. These were all missions that might need to be done to
support a city environment. In the robot game, a robot designed by the team
and built entirely from Lego Mindstorms kits and Lego pieces had to
autonomously complete the missions on the board. Each mission had a specific
point value.


## The Project

The Research Assignment for City Sights asked teams to...

  * Pick one of a selected number of Cities (or teams could choose their own city) 
  * Research that city to determine problems that city faces 
  * Design a solution using robotics technology to solve the problem 
  * Create a cool presentation and be prepared to present it to the judges at the tournament
