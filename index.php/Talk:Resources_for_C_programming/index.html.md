# Talk:Resources for C programming

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

I reorganized the page slightly. To me it made it flow better, and provide the
most relavent information first. I didn't include the software section at the
end, only because I had already linked to the stuff there within the rest of
the article, though that's not to say it can't be added back. Also, I left a
bunch of sections blank, and didn't change the books descriptions (something I
wanted to do, it sounds like you're trying to sell the books rather than give
useful feedback ... almost like it's from the book's publisher?). I do plan to
come back later, when I have the time or otherwise need to procrastinate ...
but please feel free to fill in what I left out.
