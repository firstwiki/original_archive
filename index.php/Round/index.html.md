At a [FIRST LEGO League](FIRST_LEGO_League "FIRST LEGO League") tournament, the process of cycling all teams through one [match](Match "Match") each is called a round. Most tournaments run at least 3 rounds, and teams have time between their [matches](Match "Match") to go to the [pit area](/index.php?title=Pit_area&action=edit "Pit area") and work on the robot and its programs as needed.
