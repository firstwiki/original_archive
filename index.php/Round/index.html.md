At a [FIRST LEGO League](FIRST_LEGO_League "FIRST LEGO League" )
tournament, the process of cycling all teams through one
[match](Match "Match" ) each is called a round. Most tournaments
run at least 3 rounds, and teams have time between their
[matches](Match "Match" ) to go to the [pit
area](/index.php?title=Pit_area&action=edit "Pit area" ) and work on the robot
and its programs as needed.
