##  PHP/MediaWiki upgrade

It appears that this is an [old version](/index.php/Special:Version
"Special:Version" ) of MediaWiki, which doesn't support some of the latest
parser features (#if for example). What would it take to upgrade PHP and then
MediaWiki? --[Nibbles](/index.php?title=User:Nibbles&action=edit

    It would take an upgrade to PHP 5. It is up to Brandon to do, and because he runs Chiefdelphi with a lot of custom code on the same server, it is an issue for him to upgrade. I haven't talked to him about it in several years so I will do so again soon and see what the deal is. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](/index.php/1257 "1257" )] 20:21, 25 April 2008 (EDT)

##  RFB

Hi, I have an RFB. Care to do something with it? Thanks.
