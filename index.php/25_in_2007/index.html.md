## Build

Running off the same design base and mast for most of the build season, their
manipulator went through several design changes in a matter of days. From
brushes to bananas, the manipulator was but one of the bumps hit by 25 in the
2007 build season. Scrapping their ramp a day before ship it was replaced with
a large blue shell resting on the back.
