##  Index of Regionals and Team Info

[Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ), if there was some
change you were trying to make to the [Index of
Regionals](Index_of_Regionals "Index of Regionals" ) and [Team
Info](Team_Info "Team Info" ) pages, I am able to make them for you
if you tell me what they are. I left you a message in the [FIRSTwiki
talk:Uneditable Articles](FIRSTwiki_talk:Uneditable_Articles
"FIRSTwiki talk:Uneditable Articles" ) page, but I figured you would probably
see it here first. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" )

  * Heh, I can't edit my own user page. I posted some edits to <http://nate.laverdure.googlepages.com/edits.txt> for now. [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 01:45, 2 December 2007 (EST)
