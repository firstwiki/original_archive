## History

Started in 1998 as a team building exercise for Team [190](/index.php/190
"190" ) the competition has grown to include all FIRST teams who are
interested in participating. The competition used RC cars until 2002 when it
was converted to use the new IFI Edu-bot. In 2003 it was opened to all FIRST
teams and then in 2004 to anyone who had a kit to compete. There were 14 teams
in 2004 from three states. The competition has grown dramatically in recent
years, with over 50 teams from around New England in 2006.


## About

The competition is based off of FIRST and is created every year by WPI. Teams
build a robot in four weeks using the [Robovation](/index.php/Robovation
"Robovation" ) or [Vex](/index.php/Vex "Vex" ) kit.
