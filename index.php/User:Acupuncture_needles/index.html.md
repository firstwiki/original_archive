with no such fluff, and wish not. It is been shown to be a superb treatment
for a few health issues, however less therefore for others.

The number one area wherever acupuncture has tried to be a boon is in pain
management. Chronic pain could be a nightmare. the answer in western medicine
is to medicate the patient. The matter, of course, is that the medications
