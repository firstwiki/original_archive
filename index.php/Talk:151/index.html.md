## Awards in 2001 & 2002

I believe we got a Controls award in 2001 for the work Justin Marrese and Bobbiejean Harriman did with Low Rider, including white papers describing the balancing system.

And I don't remember the details of the animation awards in 2002, but I think we only shared in the glory of Merrimack's award (having given them a virtual hand, in exchange for some lighting assistance. :P) --[Insinr8](/index.php?title=User:Insinr8&action=edit "User:Insinr8") 15:01, 6 March 2009 (EST)
