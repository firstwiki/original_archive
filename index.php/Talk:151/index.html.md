##  Awards in 2001 &amp; 2002

I believe we got a Controls award in 2001 for the work Justin Marrese and
Bobbiejean Harriman did with Low Rider, including white papers describing the
balancing system.

And I don't remember the details of the animation awards in 2002, but I think
we only shared in the glory of Merrimack's award (having given them a virtual
hand, in exchange for some lighting assistance. :P)
