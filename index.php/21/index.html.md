## History

Founded in 1997, ComBBAT is a participant in the FIRST Robotics League.

There are 9 student members on the 2005 team. ComBBAT works out of a
storefront in the Searstown mall in Titusville, FL, which is the hub of the
two rival schools' combined focus; and also in the heart of the Space Coast.
ComBBAT's location gives the team the honor of being able to work with Boeing
engineers, such as Scott Strickland. The team is also supported by a teacher
from AHS, Mr. White, as well as numerous parent mentors that influence
everyone on the team to strive for excellence.

ComBBAT's workshop, the BBATcave, is where students strive non-stop for 6
weeks each year to build a robot to compete in the game provided by FIRST. For
6 years, the Searstown Mall allowed the public to come by to learn more about
us and get involved. ComBBAT's new BBATcave is located in 2 classrooms at the
Whispering Hills Adult Education Center. During build season, we are usually
working 4pm-7pm Monday-Thursday and 8am-2pm on Saturdays. The public is
invited to come out and participate with the team.

At competition, ComBBAT has a reputation for being spirited, professional,
sportsmanly, and loud.
