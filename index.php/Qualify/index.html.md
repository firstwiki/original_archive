Since 2001, [teams](FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team" )
have had to qualify to go to the [national
championship](National_championship "National championship" ) each
year. Qualification requirements may be different every year. Check [the FIRST
website](http://www.usfirst.org/ "http://www.usfirst.org/" ) for up-to-date
qualification information.

When the qualification system was first implemented, on alternating years even
or odd numbered teams would automatically qualify, and additional
qualification would be based on a points system, with varying points being
assigned for different awards. Since the beginning, the (national) [Chairman's
Award](Chairman%27s_Award "Chairman's Award" ) winners were
reserved a spot at the [national
championship](National_championship "National championship" ).
Since then, the system has changed to a tier based structure, basing
qualification more on how long a team has not been to the nationals. There has
been considerable controversy over the varying methods, which go to the heart
of [FIRST's Philosophy](/index.php?title=FIRST%27s_philosophy&action=edit
"FIRST's philosophy" ) \-- the issue being creating a championship that is
challenging and exciting to watch, while not focussing on the competition
aspect of the event as much as the rest of it.
