Hello! My name is Ryan Hall, and I am the Co-CEO for the [Pascack Pi-oneers, Team 1676](1676 "1676"), for the 2011-2012 school year, as well as the Carpentry sub-division leader. I became an administrator on the FIRSTwiki on May 25th, 2011, and a bureaucrat on June 16th, 2011.

I am the one who originally posted [revival thread on Chief Delphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=95338|the "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=95338|the"), and believe that this site can become a thriving source of information. As such, I have [nominated myself to become a Bureaucrat](FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for
_adminship#2011_FIRSTwiki_Revival_Bureaucrat_Nominations "FIRSTwiki:Nominations for adminship") and lead the tremendous task of bringing this wiki back to life.

The easiest way to contact me would be to email me at hallry AT pascack.k12.nj.us, but you can also contact me on Chief Delphi, [[1]](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=34350|here "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=34350|here").
