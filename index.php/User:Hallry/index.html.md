Hello! My name is Ryan Hall, and I am the Co-CEO for the [Pascack Pi-oneers,
Team 1676](/index.php/1676 "1676" ), for the 2011-2012 school year, as well as
the Carpentry sub-division leader. I became an administrator on the FIRSTwiki
on May 25th, 2011, and a bureaucrat on June 16th, 2011.

I am the one who originally posted [revival thread on Chief
Delphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=95338|the
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=95338|the" ), and believe
that this site can become a thriving source of information. As such, I have
[nominated myself to become a Bureaucrat](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for
_adminship#2011_FIRSTwiki_Revival_Bureaucrat_Nominations
"FIRSTwiki:Nominations for adminship" ) and lead the tremendous task of
bringing this wiki back to life.

The easiest way to contact me would be to email me at hallry AT
pascack.k12.nj.us, but you can also contact me on Chief Delphi,
