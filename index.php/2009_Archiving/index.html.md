##  Where to Send Video

Contact Greg Marra or Jonathan Norris on the Chief Delphi forums for more
information about how to send video to the TBA and SOAP Archives via FTP.

##  How to Archive

How To Record" )]

###  How To Record

This is the most often asked question, and finally I have a simple answer for
everyone. the [Pinnacle Video
Transfer](http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/PinnacleLife/PinnaclePVT
"http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/PinnacleLife/PinnaclePVT" ), its a
$99 ($95 on amazon, I've seen it for $70 on ebay) device that records a
component video and audio input right to an external hard drive at the push of
a button in glorious h.264.

If you are looking for a more low cost solution (requiring a computer, and
someone to watch the computer..) check out [last year's
thread](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=62197
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=62197" ).

As for where to capture the video from, FIRST at all its Regionals provides a
station with about 20 outputs where you can hook right into the main
scoreboard video feed. We prefer this feed over you recording the matches with
a camcorder, FIRST hires a professional company at every regional to tape the
matches.

Parsing and Cutting Up the Video Into Individual Matches" )]

###  Parsing and Cutting Up the Video Into Individual Matches

If you really don't have time to do this after recording a regional, please
contact us and we will instruct you where to upload the raw video.

This can be done with whatever video editing program you would like, every
windows machine comes with windows movie maker (I think Vista does... I'm a
mac user) and every Mac comes with iMovie. As for the output video and naming
standards please see below!

[[edit](/index.php?title=2009_Archiving&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section:
Standards for Parsing:" )]

###  Standards for Parsing:

  * DO NOT include the announcers introduction, we are just looking for the robot action. 
  * End the video once the play has stopped, if you like you can cut in the final score (this is a bit of a pain, and TBA already has it listed on their site anyway). 

**Video Format Standards:**

  * Format: MPEG4 or H264 (.mp4, .mpv, or .mov are all acceptable containers). WMV is acceptable, but for reasons explained below not favored 
  * File Size: 15-25 Mb per file, this roughly a bitrate of: 1000-1250 kb/s, with an audio bitrate of: 128 kb/s. 
    * Video Resolution: recommended 640X480, acceptable 320X240 
    * HTTP Streaming: when encoding the video to its final format of MPEG4 or h264 enable http streaming (for most encoders it will be an option). This will allow anyone with a smart phone, iPhone, or iPod touch to stream the matches and watch them directly on their handset.

##  Archiving Format

For consistency and predictability sake, we have a preference in naming the
movie files.

[[edit](/index.php?title=2009_Archiving&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section:
General Naming Rules" )]

###  General Naming Rules

**Example File Names:**

  * ct_001.mp4 
  * fl_qf2m1.wmv 
  * ca_fm1m1.wmv 

**Naming Rules:**

  * Two or three character event abbreviation in lowercase, e.g. "fl" 
  * Underscore, "_" 
  * XOR: 
    * Qualification: Use THREE digits, "001", "047", "108". 
    * Elimination: Use "qf4m2", "sf2m1", "fm3" 
    * Awards: Use "award_" + AwardDescription. 
    * Opening: Use "openingremarks_" + "friday" or "saturday". 
    * Closing: Use "closingremarks_" + "friday" or "saturday". 
    * Else: any string that does not begin with "qf", "sf", "fm", or a digit. 
  * ".wmv" , ".mov", ".divx" , ".whatever" 

**Notes:**

  1. Always use lowercase, please. 
  2. No spaces in a filename, please. 
  3. Sometimes a match gets replayed- name the one that counts in the standings as "fl_001.wmv". The one(s) that do NOT count, "fl_001bad1.wmv", "fl_001bad2.wmv", etc...
