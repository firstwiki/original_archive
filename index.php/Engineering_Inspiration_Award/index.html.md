# Engineering Inspiration Award

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The **Engineering Inspiration Award** celebrates a [team](/index.php/Team
"Team" )’s outstanding success in advancing respect and appreciation for
engineering and engineers, both within their school and their community.
Criteria include: the extent and inventiveness of the team’s efforts to
recruit students to engineering, the extent and effectiveness of the team’s
community outreach efforts, and the measurable success of those efforts. This
is the second highest team award [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) bestows.

Unlike the [Chairman's Award](/index.php/Chairman%27s_Award "Chairman's Award"
), the Engineering Inspiration Award has no formal submission nor presentation
to the judges. In fact, many teams who do not submit for the Chairman's Award
win the Engineering Inspiration. The judges get their information from other
teams, students and [mentors](/index.php/Mentor "Mentor" ), and
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) performance.
