Reasearch Project" )]

## Reasearch Project

[Our Boat](/index.php?title=Our_Boat&action=edit "Our Boat" )\- We built a
boat out of an old refrigerator box and painted and decorated it. We used
untill we won the provincials and realized we couldn't take a massive
cardboard to Atlanta without expensive shipping. So instead we bought a blow
up boat and a lot of decorations and brought it to Atlanta. We blew up and
decorated the boat there.
