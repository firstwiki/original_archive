## Game Overview

**Lunacy** is the game for the 2009 FIRST Robotics Competition. Announced on January 3, 2009, the name and some of the features of the game honor the 40th anniversary of the first manned mission to the Moon (Latin: Luna). It is FRC's 18th game.[1]

Super Cell

- Moon Rocks (Orange and Purple) -- 120 available -- 2 pts ,
- Empty Cells (Orange and Blue) -- Up to 8 -- 2 pts
- Super Cells (Green and Purple) -- Up to 8 -- 15 pts ,

**Game Play:**

Lunacy is played on a rectangular field that is 54' by 27'. This field is a material called 'Glasliner FRP' and is referred to as 'Regolith'. The regolith is designed so that the robot's, which have special mandated wheels that they can't modify in any way, shape or form, have the same amount of traction as a robot would driving on the moon. Robot's that play have to be, at most, 38" by 28" and weigh under or equal to 120 pounds. There are 6 robots on the field at a time, 3 at each middle side on the red alliance, 3 on the blue alliance. There are 6 human players, one at each corner and then 1 of the field. These players have 20 Moon Rocks, and the players in the middle have, in addition to the 20 Moon Rocks, 4 Empty Cells. The robot's are dragging trailers behind them that correspond to the color of which alliance they are on. The goal of the game is to score as many of the Moon Rocks in the opposite side's trailer as possible. It is not possible for a robot to have any mechanism that takes Moon Rocks our of their trailer, or prevents another robot or human player from placing balls into you trailer. Robots must have bumpers on them in order to protect from damage from the collisions that will inevitably occur. Robots start out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15 second autonomous period, where robots operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2 minute Teleoperated period, where robots are driven and controlled by a human drive sub team at one end of the field. Robots can start with up to 7 Moon Rocks in their control. Empty cells must be handed to a robot. The robot, in order to get a Super Cell, must then take the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play. In order to place a Super Cell into play, an Empty Cell must be exchanged. A robot can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. There are 2 human drivers and 1 human coach. These players consist of the drive sub team.

### Mechanically

**Drive**

The robot is designed to have the option of using a crab drive(See [Drive train](Drive_train "Drive train")) to turn or have the option to use a tank drive system as well (See [Drive train](Drive_train "Drive train")). We are using two CIM motors (See [CIM motor](CIM_motor "CIM motor"))to to drive the robot. Each CIM motor has a 9:1 BaneBot Gearbox (See [banebots.com](http://banebots.com/ "http://banebots.com/")) attached to it. There is one CIM motor attached to Two wheels. All four wheels rotate a one time to achieve this we have chains going to each wheel. The motor used to rotate the Four wheels is a Globe motor (See [Globe motor](Globe_motor "Globe motor")) with a 12:1 BaneBot Gearbox.

**Intake**

For the intake we are using a set of three parallel rollers with 1.5" wide rubber belting to pull the balls up a chute and into a hopper. To move the balls we are using a CIM hooked up into a modified Toughbox Gearbox (See [AndyMark](http://andymark.biz/am-0145.html "http://andymark.biz/am-0145.html")) outputting onto a sprocket which is hooked up to our 2" diameter intake rollers.

**Hopper/Dumper**

Our hopper is essentially a sheet of fabric with a whole in it big enough to fit a ball through. It is an uncontrolled hopper. Once we are close enough to one of the robots on the opposing alliance and we have enough balls in the hopper we will "Dump". To dump we use a CIM motor attached to a modified Toughbox Gearbox and outputting to our upper roller. This winds up the sheet we use as the bottom of the hopper making the balls jump out.

### Electrically

This was the first year using national instruments and thus was a challenge. We utilized the new control system but did not use the jaguar speed controller because of a few issues we encountered.

[[edit](/index.php?title=93_during_TOBOR_XII&action=edit&section=5 "Edit
section: Program and Controls")]

### Program and Controls

The robot is programed to be able to use either crab drive mode or tank drive mode. the cool thing about the controls for this is that you do not have to switch the controls layout to switch the modes, you just use a different set of buttons.

We are using a camera to allow the diver and operator a way to see what balls are near by and are going into the intake.

**Autonomously**

We have many different autonomous modes the most used one is just to drive to the middle. We also have the capability to drive and pick up an empty cell in preparation for delivering it to the human player.
