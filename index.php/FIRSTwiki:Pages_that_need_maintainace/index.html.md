# FIRSTwiki:Pages that need maintainace

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Many articles in FIRSTwiki could do with some maintainace - the aim of FIRSTwiki is to have every article at featured status. This page is for listing those articles and catagories of articals which are still in need of changes to help reach the encyclopedic stature to which Wikipedia aspires. There are several pages already relating to artical maintainace, this one is for general maintainace issues that are not covered by such pages.

Catagories to list here:

- Articles in the page.

Catagories not to list here:

- Team article catagories
- Catagories that do not yet exist

Articles to list here:

- Articles that need work but are not part of one of the maintainace catagories listed on this page. Such articals should be accompanied by a brief explanation of what needs to be done.

Articles not to list here:

- Articles that do not yet exist - Use FIRSTwiki:Requested articles instead.
- Articles that just need cleaning up - Use FIRSTwiki:Cleanup instead.
