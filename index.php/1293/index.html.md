## History

Our rookie season was 2004. That year, Team 1293 competed in the [Palmetto
Regional](/index.php/Palmetto_Regional "Palmetto Regional" ), going 3-4-1, and
earning the 27th seed of 42. Its highlight was being in the alliance that
defeated Team [1319](/index.php/1319 "1319" ) (Golden Strip Flash), the number
one seed at the time during the qualification matches on Saturday. The team
was not picked for an alliance.


# Robots

  * 2007: Atlas. Atlas was a arm bot for [Rack and Roll](/index.php/Rack_and_Roll "Rack and Roll" )
  * 2006: Chomp. Chomp was built as a do-it-all robot for [Aim High](/index.php/Aim_High "Aim High" ). 
  * 2005: Ockham's Raizor. Designed on the [Kitbot](/index.php?title=Kitbot&action=edit "Kitbot" ) frame, Ockham used aluminum extrusion and belting to lift tetras on a simple finger over twelve feet in the air. Ockham also sported custom covers over the arm, which drew the eye of others. 
  * 2004: Bob. He was designed for herding and 2X ball manipulation on the mobile goal by use of a van door-powered winch of an arm. (The arm was removed on the final day of the Palmetto Regional.) Further, Bob's drivetrain used power window motors from the kit, a relatively unusual choice.
