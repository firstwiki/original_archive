# Short circuit

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A **short-circuit** (sometimes refered to as just a _short_) is the term used
to describe the phenomena when an [electric
circuit](/index.php?title=Electric_circuit&action=edit "Electric circuit" )
bypasses its main load, taking a shorter and unintended path. When the main
electrical load is bypassed, the [resistance](Resistance
"Resistance" ) to the flow of electrons is reduced. This results in an
increased current flowing through the 'short', which can result in excessive
heat and fire, destruction of electrical components, and/or releases of toxic
fumes.

Damage from electrical short circuits can be prevented or reduced by
installing [fuses](/index.php?title=Fuse&action=edit "Fuse" ) or [circuit
breakers](Circuit_breaker "Circuit breaker" ). The failure to have
these inline with the main circuit is very dangerous and is illegal in FIRST.
