Started" )]

###  How We Started

Eagle Robotics, [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) team 1388, consists of
students from [Arroyo Grande High School](http://www.luciamar.k12.ca.us/aghs
"http://www.luciamar.k12.ca.us/aghs" ) in Arroyo Grande, CA. The team was
founded in 2004 with help from Team 973 GRR, under the leadership of Mr.
[William Findley](/index.php/William_Findley "William Findley" ) who still is
the team leader.

###  More About Eagle Robotics team 1388

We have entered our fourth year as a USFIRST team. Our past three years have
been very successful. In our rookie year we attended the regional event held
in Sacramento; there we were awarded the "All Star Rookie Award". This award
was our ticket to the national event in Atlanta, Georgia. At this event we
worked our way to the top and won the title of Curie Division champions. Our
next year brought us victory in another way. After a few robot malfunctions at
the UC Davis regional we radically changed the design of our robot. Our
performance at the national event was not nearly as successful as our rookie
year, but our team was awarded the "Engineering Inspiration" award on behalf
of our outstanding community outreach events.

Involvement" )]

##  Community Involvement

Eagle Robotics has been very active in the community promoting science and
engineering with various activities. The team developed an Annual Catapult
Pumpkin Launch Competition where teams design and build catapults to launch
pumpkins as far as they can. [[1]](http://www.eaglerobotics.com/images/gallery

ew=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=3190&g2_GALLERYSID=f6867f16bb80788800e6a3d6073c0cf4
/" )

The team has also linked up with our schools ASB and Link Crew to put together
a Cardboard Boat Regatta. By incorporating many FIRST rules and principles
into the game, we developed a successful challenge that many sought to enter.
Teams from all over the school set out to put together boats made from duct
tape and cardboard that would fit two people and have enough speed and
strength to race other boats across the school swimming pool. Many clubs and
classes entered as well as teachers and administrators. The first competition
was such a big success last year we have invited neighboring high schools to
join in on the event.

In 2005 the Jr. Eagle Robotics FIRST Lego League Team was created in our area.
Eagle Robotics has donated materials, resources and students to mentor the
younger team. Eagle Robotics eagerly helps the FLL team, since we know they
will be the next leaders of Eagle Robotics.
