**Input** has two related senses in relation to the [FIRST Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics Competition" ): 

  * in information processing, **input** is the process of receiving information from an object 
  * in control theory, **inputs** are the signals that can be observed or affected that feed into the system 

In terms of the first definition, inputs refer to devices like
[sensors](/index.php/Sensors "Sensors" ) which connect to either the [Robot
Controller](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ) or [Operator
Interface](/index.php/Operator_Interface "Operator Interface" ) and feed them
data.
