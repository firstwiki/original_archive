**Students** make up the core of a [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) robotics [team](/index.php/Team "Team" ). 

Students work with [mentors](/index.php/Mentors "Mentors" ) and
[engineers](/index.php/Engineers "Engineers" ) to build a
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) for a [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" )
organization.


## Requirements

Students entering the program do not have to know anything about
[building](/index.php/Fabrication "Fabrication" ) robots; they can and are
encouraged to learn as they go. To be a part of the [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ) program, they must be dedicated and willing to learn; most team's
robots are entirely designed and built by the students, many of whom came in
knowing nothing about robots at all.
