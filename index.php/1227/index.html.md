## History

The Techno-Gremlins formed of few juniors from Northview and Forest Hills
Northern in 2003. They competed at the [Buckeye
Regional](Buckeye_Regional "Buckeye Regional" ), but did not
perform well. Mentor Tom Cooper came in midway through build, wishing he had
come sooner.

Students from Northview and Forest Hills Northern &amp; Central joined the
team in 2004. Because the team was working in a wood shop, the decision was
made to use fiberglass instead of aluminum; the resultant frame was heavy
because of the use of 2" square fiberglass. It fared moderately well at
[Buckeye Regional](Buckeye_Regional "Buckeye Regional" ) and [West
Michigan Regional](West_Michigan_Regional "West Michigan Regional"
), and, despite a poor seeding at the twenty-one-team [Kettering
Kickoff](Kettering_Kickoff "Kettering Kickoff" ), 1227 was on the
winning alliance for that year.

Students from the newly-opened Forest Hills Eastern joined the team in 2005.
This time, the robot was a mix of the kit frame aluminum and fiberglass. The
code also contained much more infrastructure, possibly too much, considering
the robot did poorly at the [Buckeye Regional](Buckeye_Regional
"Buckeye Regional" ) and the [West Michigan
Regional](West_Michigan_Regional "West Michigan Regional" ).
However, 1227's tenacity and persistence, particularly with the robot's arm,
garnered the team a few awards that year.

The team was incorporated into Team [904](904 "904" ) beginning in
late 2006, and no longer exists as a separate entity.
