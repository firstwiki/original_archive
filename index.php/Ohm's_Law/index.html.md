# Ohm's Law

### From FIRSTwiki

**Ohm's law** (named after its discoverer [Georg Ohm](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm "wikipedia:Georg_Ohm" )) states that the ratio of the potential difference (voltage _V_) to the current (_I_) flowing through a device is a constant ([resistance](/index.php/Resistance "Resistance" ) _R_). Namely, 

    ![{V \\over I} = R](/media/math/a/9/d/a9d18e014aa96efa3164a9481c436da8.png)

It is worth noting that this is an empirical law, i.e., not mathematically
derived. Also, it's title of _law_ is largely historical. As is often the case
in physics, this equation is for an ideal resistor; further, there are many
devices for which the law isn't even an approximation. These are called non-
ohmic devices, such as diodes (on which modern computing depends). In
actuality, resistance is dependent on temperature change. However, despite
these non-ideal situations, the _Ohm's law_ equation is still somewhat valid,
only R is no longer a constant.
