##  Challenge Summary

How do our personal energy choices to heat our homes, fuel our cars, charge
our cell phones, power our computers, or even download music to our iPods
impact the environment, economy, and life around the globe? Which resources
should we use and why? Explore how energy production and consumption choices
affect the planet and our quality of life today, tomorrow, and for future

##  Challenge Announcement

**FIRST LEGO® League Goes “Green” with 2007 “Power Puzzle” Challenge**  
More than 100,000 middle-school students in 38 countries gear up to help solve
the world’s energy problems Manchester, NH, September 5, 2007 – FIRST (For
Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), an organization
founded by inventor Dean Kamen to inspire young people’s interest and
participation in science and technology through teamwork and problem solving,
today officially launches its biggest-ever FIRST LEGO® League season with the
unveiling of the 2007 “Power Puzzle” Challenge.  

This year’s Challenge calls for teams of middle-school students, ages 9 to 14,
to use robotics to understand and create solutions for one of today’s most
critical environmental issues: energy management and conservation.  

With missions exploring solar panels on houses, hydro-dams, wind turbines and
planting trees, teams will have to program their robots to find sustainable
options to meet our planet’s growing energy needs in environmentally sound
ways.  

FIRST collaborated with the Gulf Coast Combined Heat and Power Application
Center, the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of South
Carolina and the Second Hill Group, an independent consultant that specializes
in issues including energy, environment and green design, to create a theme
and Challenge missions that are reflective of today’s real-world issues.  

“The environment is a huge concern for everyone, including kids,” said [Dean
Kamen](/index.php/Dean_Kamen "Dean Kamen" ), [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST"
) founder. "Giving them a hands-on experience that allows them to use their
imaginations and creativity in combination with science and technology to
solve a real-world problem is empowering. It captures the true spirit of FIRST
LEGO League and unleashes the creative problem-solving skills today’s kids
need for building a better tomorrow."  

FIRST will also kick off the 2007 [Junior FIRST LEGO
League](/index.php/Junior_FIRST_LEGO_League "Junior FIRST LEGO League" )
([JFLL](/index.php/JFLL "JFLL" )) “Power Puzzle” season today. Now in its
fourth year, Junior FIRST LEGO League is geared towards 6 to 9 year-olds,
introducing them to the wonders of science and technology through traditional,
open-ended LEGO building with an age-appropriate Challenge based on the FIRST
LEGO League theme.
