why does [FIRST Robotics team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics
team" ) redirect here? Isn't that the proper title? Move it back or no?

    Move. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 19:20, 26 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    I'm not sure why I said that, at least according to the current FRC-takes-priority-over-FLL name scheme, this is the proper name. --[user:max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" )

    It just seems odd that [Teams](/index.php/Teams "Teams" ) is a disambiguation page, while this isn't. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 13:16, 7 Aug 2004 (EDT) 

    Ah, good point, in my new name scheme, I didn't include any provisions for Disambiguation. I don't really think they are neccesary, but, if everyone wants it, we could put a _This page is about [FIRST Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics Competition" ) see the corresponding [FLL](/index.php/FLL "FLL" ) page [link to FLL page](/index.php?title=Link_to_FLL_page&action=edit "Link to FLL page" )._ \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 01:38, 8 Aug 2004 (EDT)
