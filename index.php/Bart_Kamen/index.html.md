Bart Kamen, MD, Ph.D was a pediatric oncologist at the Children's Medical
Center Dallas Pediatric Hospital <http://www.childrens.com/>  
He was on the faculty of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Pediatrics
Department <http://www2.umdnj.edu/pedspweb/> prior to his death in September
2012  
  
Dr. Kamen was an excellent clinician and researcher who greatly resembled in
appearance his younger brother Dean Kamen.  
He was greatly respected by his colleagues and students for his compassion and
tremendous knowledge of pediatric oncology.  
  
On rounds in 1997 Dr. Kamen was privately known among the residents as the
'Lion King' for his somewhat elevated hair style.  
He was a great favorite among students, residents and the children he treated
both for his clinical acumen, comfort of children and families under difficult
circumstances and his magic tricks.  
  
Bart Kamen died of cancer on September 27, 2012. He had a rare tumor.

His TedMed talks can be viewed on YouTube:
