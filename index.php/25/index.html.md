##  History

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: The
Beginning" )]

### The Beginning

FRC Team 25, Raider Robotix, was founded in 1997 as part of the Systemic
Science Initiative. Early on, the team struggled to field a competitive team
and gain financial support from the surrounding community.

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: National
Success" )]

### National Success

In 2000, after hosting an open house, the local branch of Bristol Myers Squibb
agreed to lend its financial and technical support to the team. This sparked
the dawn of a new era in Raider Robotix. They won the National Championship
that year, gaining them national prominence.

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Continued
Excellence" )]

### Continued Excellence

Since their 2000 win, they have continued a tradition of success both on and
off the field.

They started their own rookie support program, dubbed RINOS or Rookies In Need
of Support, which has helped to start over 30 teams nationwide. Each year,
Raider Robotix hosts its own off-season competition, known as Brunswick
Eruption, which allows local teams to continue competing into the fall. They
also strive to maintain a high level of community involvement, requiring that
each member complete ten hours of community service in order to remain active
on the roster.

On the field, 25 is continually known as a top-tier competitor and
international powerhouse. They have won numerous regionals and awards, most
notably the2006 New Jersey Regional Chairman's Award and the 2006 Championship
Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" Award. They have also written essays
that have earned two mentors, Wayne Cokeley, 25's head mentor, and Paul
Kloberg, former FIRST Senior Mentor for New Jersey, the Woodie Flowers
Finalist Award in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Raider Robotix has also
competed on Einstein four times since their National Championship win.

Perhaps the greatest accomplishment for Raider Robotix has come on the
international stage. In 2006, they were competing in the finals at the
Championship Event. A team from the opposing alliance was in need of a
critical spare part in order to continue competing. No one on their alliance
could provide the part, but 25 knew they could. They graciously allowed the
team to use their spare part to fix their robot. The opposing alliance
eventually went on to win the event. After the event, Dean Kamen wrote a
letter to the team acknowledging their sacrifice and praising them for
upholding FIRST's ideal of Gracious Professionalism, even at the cost of
losing the Championship Event.

## Projects

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Rookies in
Need of Support" )]

### Rookies in Need of Support

Rookies in Need of Support, or RINOS, was started by Raider Robotix in an
effort to provide rookie teams with a place to turn for advice and help in
their first year of competition. RINOS mentors aid the newcomers in how to
gain community support, find funding, get students interested, and how to
efficiently manage their time. Many mentor teams provide the new team with a
robot so they can compete as pre-rookies at off-season events before the
official season begins. The RINOS program provides manuals for the mentoring
team, as well as the rookie team. These manuals, as well as other resources,
can be found [on the FIRST RINOS homepage](http://raiderrobotix.org/rinos/
"http://raiderrobotix.org/rinos/" ).

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Brunswick
Eruption" )]

### Brunswick Eruption

Each fall, Raider Robotix hosts an off-season competition held in their high
school gym. The competition usually follows official FIRST competition rules,
although slight changes have been made in previous years. Teams are encouraged
to bring pre-rookie teams to the event and are often offered a discounted
entry fee. The event generally has 30-40 participating teams from NJ, NY, DE,
and PA with some teams traveling from Canada or Maryland to attend. Aside from
offering teams a place to compete with their robot during the fall, the
competition also allows team 25 to invite members from the local community to
attend and get excited about robotics.

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Community
Involvement" )]

### Community Involvement

It has been a longstanding requirement that all members complete at least ten
hours of community service in order to be placed on the roster for the season.
The team frequently participates in group community service projects and have
a strong relationship with the North Brunswick Senior Citizen Center and the
North Brunswick Food Pantry. Many students also lend their aid to local
hospitals, soup kitchens, religious organisations, and fire departments.

[[edit](/index.php?title=25&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Raider
Robotix LEGO Camp" )]

### Raider Robotix LEGO Camp

In an effort to get younger students interested in and excited about FIRST
Robotics, Raider Robotix hosts a summer LEGO robotics camp. During the two
weeks, middle school students are introduced to simple robot design,
construction, and programming through the use of the LEGO Mindstorms and LEGO
NXT robotics kits. They are given certain tasks to complete, such as following
a line using a light sensor or building a simple drag racing robot, and have a
few days to build an effective robot.

##  Sponsors

  * **Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS)**: Since 2000, Bristol-Myers Squibb &amp; Company has generously supported team 25 by providing funds, and mentors with machining capabilities. After winning the National Championship that year, BMS expanded its support to 6 other teams in New Jersey and Connecticut. 
  * **Day Tool &amp; Mfg., Inc.**: After BMS had to make some cutbacks in 2010, a lot of machining and other engineering resources were lost. Day Tool &amp; Mfg., Inc., originally a sponsor of [103](/index.php/103 "103" ), graciously stepped in to sponsor and support Team 25 by donating time and labor in the manufacturing of parts for our robot. 
  * **Cirque du Soleil**: At the end of the 2009-2010 season, world-renowned Cirque du Soleil awarded their Cirque du Soleil Prize for Best Design to Raider Robotix. We’re incredibly honored to be recognized by this peerless organization. The $5,000 award went a long way toward keeping the team afloat financially. 
  * **North Brunswick Board of Education**: After the team’s victory at the 2011 Virgina regional, with a bank account of close to $0, Raider Robotix was desperately looking around for money to help pay for transportation and the registration of the 2011 World Championships. With just a few days notice the North Brunswick Board of Education came through with $5,000 to help pay for registration, and ultimately the trip to St. Louis., where team 25 won its division and made it to the final four on the Einstein field. 
  * **Time Warner Inc.**
  * **Royal Hawaiian Creations**: Team 25 works with Royal Hawaiian Creations, located in Hawaii, each year to obtain the authentic Hawaiian shirts that are a part of our team's signature uniform. 
  * **Infrared Remote Solutions**: In the 2008 season, team 25 worked with Infrared Remote Solutions to develop an IR remote control system that allowed us to control our robot's every move during the "Hybrid" portion of that year's game; this was a large contribution to our on-field success that season.
