# Error

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Error is the difference between the theoretical output value and the real output value. Error values are used by [closed loop](closed-loop) systems to calculate output values that will decrease the error.

For example, if the [Robot Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot
Controller") sends a [PWM](pwm) signal to a [motor](motor) to make it run at 30% of its top speed, but the [motor](motor) only runs at 26%, then an error would exist of 4% of the top speed.
