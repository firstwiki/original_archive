## History

**Kickoff** During their rookie year this team proposed the idea of an offsite Kickoff to Dean Kamen. Until then, only 2 members from each team were allowed to attend the Kickoff in New Hampshire. Their vision would spread the message of FIRST to thousands of students, alumni, mentors and parents involved in robotics. Dean Kamen agreed and in ’02 Team 503 team hosted the first offsite Kickoff in the world with over 2000 people attending from 89 teams. 503 continues to host the largest offsite Kickoff every year. They offer 7-13 workshops to the attending teams and provide them with an opportunity to touch, observe and measure the field elements. Since ’02 this Kickoff has served as a model for 49 other offsite Kickoffs that have emerged around the world. Team 503 invites college representatives, school administrators, and state senators and introduces them to our world of science and technology. After Senator Nancy Cassis attended she invited Team 503 to the State Senate where 2 members of their team introduced the concept of FIRST. What started an idea between high school students spread, and has ultimately impacted each person from every team involved in FRC. 

**Community Involvement** This team consistently works to expose more people in their community and and educational system to the FIRST world. Each year they present our robot to the Novi Community School District to encourage excitement over science and technology, this year reaching 4,500 students. The robot appears for the 200 residents at the Fox Run Retirement community to demonstrate the robot and show what teamwork and dedication can accomplish. To further promote FIRST in their community they present their robot at the City Fair impacting 1,000 residents and make it available for the 37,500 that attended the Michigan State Fair. Their robot consistently makes appearances at the State FLL competition in Novi and displays future opportunities available to the 800 FLL kids. At the YES! event (Youth in Engineering and Science) their robot was displayed for the 15,000 that attended. The expo inspires kids to pursue careers in engineering and our demonstration inspired Fredrick Douglass Academy, Ogemaw Heights, and Traverse City Central to create FRC teams of their own. In ’05 at the grand opening of the Rock Financial Showplace, they had an opportunity to incorporate their team and FIRST into the opening of one of the largest expo centers in the country. They invited 10 other teams to create a mock competition and demonstrate their enthusiasm for the 900 VIPs and 75,000 others that attended. For 2 weeks the event was advertised on a marquee to 300,000 drivers on Interstate 96 daily. Frog Force strives to be a positive influence in the FIRST community and spread the message of FIRST wherever they go.
