One of the two basic [skid steer](/index.php/Skid_steer "Skid steer" ) [drive
trains](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train" ) included in the [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) is designed to utilize one or
two CIM motors on each side of the [robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ). This
exact motor has been known over the years as the "CIM", "Chiaphua", or
"Atwood" motor. The motor is provided in the kit of parts as part number
"FR801-001". Some years have also shipped a larger three inch "Mini-bike"
motor (part number FP801-005).

Notes" )]

## Usage Notes

  * Partially because of the CIM's relatively large size and consequentially low power density, the motor can withstand longer periods at, or near, stall. CIM do not burn out nearly as often as a [drill motor](/index.php/Drill_motor "Drill motor" ) or a [fisher price motor](/index.php/Fisher_price_motor "Fisher price motor" ). 
  * Because the CIM is not designed for a specific application like the (obsolete) [drill motor](/index.php/Drill_motor "Drill motor" ), it has little or no [wiring bias](/index.php/Wiring_bias "Wiring bias" ). This means the motor is equally powerful in forward in reverse. This can be useful in many applications. For example, drive trains which involve a pair of motors running in opposite directions can suffer from driving in a large radius circle when both motors are set to equal speeds. The CIM is relatively immune from such problems in that situation.
