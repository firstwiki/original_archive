# Digital

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A **digital** signal is a signal that is intended to be used in discrete
increments. It is different from an [analog](/index.php/Analog "Analog" )
signal which does not have any discrete value assigned to it but has the
possibility of continuous values. In terms of [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST"
), and specifically the [Robot Controller](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot
Controller" ), digital refers to a type of input where the interpreted value
is either _true_ or _false_ (1 or 0).
