## Team Information

“Putting all of that book learning to practical use...”

We're a relatively small but very experienced FIRST team – original competing
in the 1996 “Competition” with a PVC-and-wood robot. In this ten year period,
we have bootstrapped and mentored five other North Florida teams. We regularly
fabricate parts for local teams that need assistance. In this period we have
“graduated” over 200 students.

Our team students take the lead in the design, fabrication, and programming of
each robot competitor. These students train year-round in all of the skills
needed to build a winning robot – including the use of our Autodesk Inventor
software, machine tool and welding skills, and programming.

We build our robot in a team mentor's home workshop. Each student develops at
least one “specialty” skill – whether it is welding, lathe or mill operation,
CAD design, website, or programming. Everyone gets to do a little of
everything.

Our team consists of two lead adult mentors plus a handful of parents. We're
sponsored by Johnson and Johnson “VISTAKON” (an all-robotic contact lens
manufacturing firm) and JEA (the municipal electric/water/wastewater utility
for Jacksonville Florida).

Our team motto is “Going against the Current” and our team robot is named
“OHMER” in keeping with our geeky physics motif.
