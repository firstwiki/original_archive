# Shorten your resume

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

One mistake people often make when putting together a resume is being too
wordy. The standard length of a resume is only one page, so you don?t have
space to be superfluous. Start your resume points with active verbs whenever
possible and don?t use passive voice. Additionally, shorten your
[resume](http://www.resumesplanet.com/samples.php
"http://www.resumesplanet.com/samples.php" ) by using only work experience
that is relevant to the position you want. You can always explain any gaps in
your work history during your interview.
