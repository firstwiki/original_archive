# Shorten your resume

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

One mistake people often make when putting together a resume is being too wordy. The standard length of a resume is only one page, so you don?t have space to be superfluous. Start your resume points with active verbs whenever possible and don?t use passive voice. Additionally, shorten your [resume](http://www.resumesplanet.com/samples.php "http://www.resumesplanet.com/samples.php") by using only work experience that is relevant to the position you want. You can always explain any gaps in your work history during your interview.
