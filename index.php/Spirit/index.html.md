**Spirit** is organized enthusiasm.

Many teams have dedicated Spirit sub-teams. These teams provide a defined and enthusiastic team image at competitions. Often this involves handing out promotional items (such as buttons) to other teams, which help make a team memorable when it comes time to pick alliance partners. [Mascots](Mascot "Mascot"), team costumes (including face paint and dye), and banners are also involved with this area.
