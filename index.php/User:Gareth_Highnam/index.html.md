## Gareth's Page

"Will be updated!"

The quote above has been the newest update since two years ago. For anyone who reads this on a regular basis (may god save your soul somehow) I felt it would be courteous to inform you to the fact that following our transformation into team _Vae Victus_ for 2005 with our not-incredibly-performing-but-hella-cool- looking robot Manus Imperatorus, 95% of all our members GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL (including myself), and probably do not even realize this page exists.
