what direction is "so the axle turns away from the motor" Whats away and what's towards? --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 11:59, 28 May 2004 (EDT)

If you look at it the way it is shipped, the motor is the big black thing. its axle turns a worm gear which turns the gear and the part that you atach to. If you turn the external part so that the worm goes towards (into) the motor, get a new one. I don't know if the direction is clockwise or counter-clockwise. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303")

## Motor names

The 2008 KOP calls it the "Denso window motor" so I am gonna link to that. The article currently says Nippon-Denso motor, and I can't find any other source that calls it that. I need sources, I am just copying the numbers on the page before! If anyone can find a data sheet that would be great. --[Nibbles](/index.php?title=User:Nibbles&action=edit "User:Nibbles") 17:31, 13 September 2008 (EDT)
