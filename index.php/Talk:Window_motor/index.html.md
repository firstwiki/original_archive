what direction is "so the axle turns away from the motor" Whats away and
what's towards? --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 11:59, 28 May 2004

If you look at it the way it is shipped, the motor is the big black thing. its
axle turns a worm gear which turns the gear and the part that you atach to. If
you turn the external part so that the worm goes towards (into) the motor, get
a new one. I don't know if the direction is clockwise or counter-clockwise.

##  Motor names

The 2008 KOP calls it the "Denso window motor" so I am gonna link to that. The
article currently says Nippon-Denso motor, and I can't find any other source
that calls it that. I need sources, I am just copying the numbers on the page
before! If anyone can find a data sheet that would be great.
