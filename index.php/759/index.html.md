## History

Systemetric (759) is a team comprised of students from Lower and Upper Sixth (16-18 year olds) at Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, UK. The team was the first from the United Kingdom to enter the [FIRST](first) Robotics competition and has become a regular at the [New York City Regional](New_York_City_Regional "New York City Regional") since their Rookie year in 2002.

The teams name comes from the Metric system of measurement. The words Metric and system were switched around (system metric) and merged to create the team name. This is because although Feet and Yards are still in common use in America, Metres and Centimetres have replaced them as the more familiar units of measurement in the UK.

The team has built up a proud record of achievements, including winning the NYC Regional in 2004\. Unfortunately, Systemetric were unable to attend the finals in Atlanta due to a shortage of funds and the timing of examinations.

With (British) Union Flag T-shirts, the team were very noticeable in 2005, and with the team robot [Eric](Eric_the_Hedgehog_%28759%29 "Eric the
Hedgehog \(759\)") in the same colours of Blue, White and Red, the team won the [Imagery Award](Imagery_Award "Imagery Award"). Systemetric followed this up in 2006 with a more subtle colour scheme with a well recieved slogan; "Don't Walk, Do the Robot", and after finishing the qualifiers ranked 7th, went on to lose in the Regional final as captains of Alliance 5, their partners being [694](694 "694") and [421](421 "421").
