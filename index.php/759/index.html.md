## History

Systemetric (759) is a team comprised of students from Lower and Upper Sixth
(16-18 year olds) at Hills Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge, UK. The team
was the first from the United Kingdom to enter the [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ) Robotics competition and has become a regular at the [New York City
Regional](/index.php/New_York_City_Regional "New York City Regional" ) since
their Rookie year in 2002.

The teams name comes from the Metric system of measurement. The words Metric
and system were switched around (system metric) and merged to create the team
name. This is because although Feet and Yards are still in common use in
America, Metres and Centimetres have replaced them as the more familiar units
of measurement in the UK.

The team has built up a proud record of achievements, including winning the
NYC Regional in 2004. Unfortunately, Systemetric were unable to attend the
finals in Atlanta due to a shortage of funds and the timing of examinations.

With (British) Union Flag T-shirts, the team were very noticeable in 2005, and
with the team robot [Eric](/index.php/Eric_the_Hedgehog_%28759%29 "Eric the
Hedgehog \(759\)" ) in the same colours of Blue, White and Red, the team won
the [Imagery Award](/index.php/Imagery_Award "Imagery Award" ). Systemetric
followed this up in 2006 with a more subtle colour scheme with a well recieved
slogan; "Don't Walk, Do the Robot", and after finishing the qualifiers ranked
7th, went on to lose in the Regional final as captains of Alliance 5, their
partners being [694](/index.php/694 "694" ) and [421](/index.php/421 "421" ).
