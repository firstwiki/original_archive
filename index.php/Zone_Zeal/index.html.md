## Field Layout

In Zone Zeal the field was split up in to 5 Zones. Closest to the drivers
station was the Home Zone. Next was the opponents scoring zone. Then a neutral
zone where the 3 rolling goals started. Next was your scoring zone, followed
by the opponents home zone. The rolling goals were hexagonal about 36" across
and about 5' tall. The sides of the goal were PVC pipe from about 18" on up
and in the center was a larger PVC pipe. The goals could be filled with 8"
soccer balls that were located along the wall (20 per side) in the center of
the field.


## Game Description

Ten points were awarded for placing the a goal in your scoring zone. 1 point
for each ball in a goal that was in your scoring zone or in the opponents home
zone. And 10 points for each robot touching your home zone. A popular design
this year was the use of measuring tapes to slide back and touch your home
zone.


## Tournament Structure

For seeding matches the winning alliance was awarded qualifying points equal
to 3 times the losing alliances score. Mean that if an alliance was completely
shut out in a seeding match the winning alliance would receive no qualifying
points.

During the elimination matches the it was a best of 3 three set. So
elimination match often became a tug of war battle to try and score the
rolling goals.
