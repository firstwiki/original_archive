**How-to** articles attempt to describe how to go about common tasks. For instance, a [programming](Programming "Programming" ) how-to might describe the process of [downloading a program](Downloading_a_program "Downloading a program" ), while a [team management](Team_management "Team management" ) how-to might describe the process of [starting a team](Starting_a_team "Starting a team" ). This page lists the variuos how-tos that [FIRSTwiki](FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki" ) currently has, or would like to have.
