## History

## Rookie Year

In 2006, Orchard Park Secondary School Computer Engineering teacher Stan Hunter started the OP Patriotics known then as team 2000\. This team went to the Canada's Wonderland Invitational using a borrowed robot from future mentor Tyler Holtzman. Receiving the 2nd Place Award, X's and O's Strategy Award, and the Ramp Racer Award, the team was ready to triumph in the [2007 Challenge](http://www.usfirst.org/ "http://www.usfirst.org/").

-Regionals-

The start of a new elite team began with the 2007 Waterloo Regional when the rookie sensation ran through preliminaries with a 8-2-1 record (5th Seed). The commencement of a tradition formed as 1st seeded Team 1114 (Simbotics), chose the Rookie Allstars as their first pick, after the Rookies graciously accepted this offer. The 1st seeded alliance (1114,2056,771) then played the elimination rounds only losing one of their 9 matches, successfully securing the Rookie Team their very first Regional Championship Award, along with the Rookie Allstar Award and Highest Rookie Seed Award.

The high lived glory of their first Regional win was short lived as the team was scheduled to compete in an event that would require all their concentration the very next week. As the Rookie team began to set a trend of winning, they came into the 2007 Greater Toronto Regional running, going undefeated through the preliminaries and securing themselves 1st Seed. The Rookie team then selected Team 1114 as their first round pick. This alliance (2056,1114,176) went with only one loss throughout the Elminations matches. If any indication of events to come the Rookie Sensation had now won their first 2 regionals ever.

-National Championships-

The rookie team looked to make a mark at their first Nation Championship showing at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. Going 5-2-0 in preliminations the Rookie team was then picked in the first round by Team 1712 (Dawgma). The alliance (1712,2056,703) then competed in a hard fought Quarter-Finals match in which they won in a rubber match. Now continuing to a difficult semi-finals the rookie team saw its first elimination as a team in Match 3 of the Semi- Finals.

-Indiana Robotics Invitational-

Comming off of their first ever elimination as an FRC team, the rookie sensation looked at the experience as a replenishment of their drive. Diving into arguable the most prestigious event available to a FRC team, the rookies finished preliminaries with a 5-3-0 record. First seeded Team 1114 selected 111 (Wildstang) during the first round of alliance selections. For their second pick the alliance selected the rookie team that managed to sneak into the second round of selections. The alliance (1114,111,2056,494) then went with only one loss in eliminations. This event solidfying the rookie team as a likely elite level team.
