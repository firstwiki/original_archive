## History

[[edit](/index.php?title=2056&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Rookie
Year" )]

## Rookie Year

In 2006, Orchard Park Secondary School Computer Engineering teacher Stan
Hunter started the OP Patriotics known then as team 2000. This team went to
the Canada's Wonderland Invitational using a borrowed robot from future mentor
Tyler Holtzman. Receiving the 2nd Place Award, X's and O's Strategy Award, and
the Ramp Racer Award, the team was ready to triumph in the [2007
Challenge](http://www.usfirst.org/ "http://www.usfirst.org/" ).

  
-Regionals- 

  
The start of a new elite team began with the 2007 Waterloo Regional when the
rookie sensation ran through preliminaries with a 8-2-1 record (5th Seed). The
commencement of a tradition formed as 1st seeded Team 1114 (Simbotics), chose
the Rookie Allstars as their first pick, after the Rookies graciously accepted
this offer. The 1st seeded alliance (1114,2056,771) then played the
elimination rounds only losing one of their 9 matches, successfully securing
the Rookie Team their very first Regional Championship Award, along with the
Rookie Allstar Award and Highest Rookie Seed Award.

  
The high lived glory of their first Regional win was short lived as the team
was scheduled to compete in an event that would require all their
concentration the very next week. As the Rookie team began to set a trend of
winning, they came into the 2007 Greater Toronto Regional running, going
undefeated through the preliminaries and securing themselves 1st Seed. The
Rookie team then selected Team 1114 as their first round pick. This alliance
(2056,1114,176) went with only one loss throughout the Elminations matches. If
any indication of events to come the Rookie Sensation had now won their first
2 regionals ever.

  

-National Championships- 

  

The rookie team looked to make a mark at their first Nation Championship
showing at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. Going 5-2-0 in preliminations the
Rookie team was then picked in the first round by Team 1712 (Dawgma). The
alliance (1712,2056,703) then competed in a hard fought Quarter-Finals match
in which they won in a rubber match. Now continuing to a difficult semi-finals
the rookie team saw its first elimination as a team in Match 3 of the Semi-
Finals.

  
-Indiana Robotics Invitational- 

  
Comming off of their first ever elimination as an FRC team, the rookie
sensation looked at the experience as a replenishment of their drive. Diving
into arguable the most prestigious event available to a FRC team, the rookies
finished preliminaries with a 5-3-0 record. First seeded Team 1114 selected
111 (Wildstang) during the first round of alliance selections. For their
second pick the alliance selected the rookie team that managed to sneak into
the second round of selections. The alliance (1114,111,2056,494) then went
with only one loss in eliminations. This event solidfying the rookie team as a
likely elite level team.
