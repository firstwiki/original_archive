I've removed the zip-file link...it can be put back if it ever goes up. Text
was: [[Media:FIRST_Frenzy.zip|The game docs in ZIP]]: 15,592,322 Bytes (14.8
MB). (Probably won't go up) --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch

Doh! of course it was 15 seconds! I'm so ashamed...

The article over at wikipedia had its content wiped for a copyright violation
(by the same name). So maybe when someone works on this, they can port it over
there? Just a thought. Also, it is worth a discussion (I assume here, rather
than at page formats?) on what format this article (and others like it) should
take. It might be useful to include some choice CD quotes about the season
(maybe a spotlight or two). Definately the winning alliance's robots. Rules.
Playing field pic. Quick intro/game description. Etc. many times over. I'll
try to come up with something as a baseline format to work on ...

Well, My zip of the Docs is 14 MB. I stuck in a link, but it's inoperable.

    What copyright, exactly? Posting docs here eases on their bandwidth, we aren't taking credit, and it's about the game. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 22:23, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Sorry, I wasn't very clear at all. (If wikipedia's servers weren't so blasted slow!) I meant that the article at [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org "http://wikipedia.org" ). It got this comment: _FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar - ugly. Is this original work or a copyvio? It is. Burgundavia 11:07, 24 May 2004 (UTC)_ and was wiped out. I thought that once the article here was written, it could be put on wikipedia's page too. Then I got sidetracked, trying to think how I'd write the article :D See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar" ) for more info. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 22:28, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Hehe...that's why copy-pasting the game page from your team's webpage into Wikipedia is probably _not_ a good idea.... --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 11:53, 18 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I just put a small stub under a similar name that pointed to us. oops... I
JUST SLASHDOTTED US! --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303
