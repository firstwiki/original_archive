## Rookie Year

According to the FIRST page for 4
([[[1]](http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=4
"http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=4" )]), their
rookie year is 2004, but the team didn't actually compete until 2006. Do they
then become 2004 rookies, but inactive in 2004 and 2005? Weird.
