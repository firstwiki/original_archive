## Rookie Year

According to the FIRST page for 4 ([[[1]](http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=4 "http://www.usfirst.org/frc/map/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=4")]), their rookie year is 2004, but the team didn't actually compete until 2006\. Do they then become 2004 rookies, but inactive in 2004 and 2005? Weird. --[Billfred](User:Billfred "User:Billfred") 21:53, 7 May 2006 (EDT)
