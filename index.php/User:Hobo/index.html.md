Hola. I am on team 1523 (you probably noticed by all of my edits :P). I just made this page so that when people get mad at me they can leave a little note on how dumb I am.

Anyway, my name is Tim Arnold, designer, producer, creator, editor... everything of MARS's website, [[Marsbot.org](http://www.marsbot.org "http://www.marsbot.org")]. If nothing else you now know who to blame for the horrors! I also designed the team logo and shirts. Team captain in 2005's rookie season.

I often hang out in IRC. #robotics on irc.freenode.net (the unofficial FIRST chat apparently), #hackaday, #xbmc, #php on EFnet.

Anyway, have a nice day!
