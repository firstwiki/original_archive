## History

  * Team 1923, The MidKnight Inventors, began as a rookie team in 2006. 
  * Based in West Windsor, NJ, the team is primarily made up of students from West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North. 
  * Originally called Royal Knights Robotics, the team name changed as the team welcomed students from our rival high school (WWP HS South) in 2008. 


## Robots

  * Sir Lance-A-Bot (2006) 
  * Optimus Prime (2007) 
  * The Knight Rider (2008) 
  * Low-Budget Awesome (2009) 
  * Wobot (2010) 
  * La Flama Blanca (2011) [Minibots named RoBhavish, IterationX, and RoBhavish 2.0] 


## Accomplishments

  * 2009 NJ Regional Champions (with [2753](/index.php?title=2753&action=edit "2753" ) &amp; [2344](/index.php?title=2344&action=edit "2344" )) 
  * 2010 Boston Regional Engineering Inspiration Award

  * 2011 CT Regional [Gracious Professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_Professionalism "Gracious Professionalism" ) Award 


## Sponsors

  * For our first two seasons we received the NASA program growth grant for beginning teams. 
  * For our third (2008) season, we received a number of donations from private, anonymous entities who requested that we refer to them as 'Friends of 1923'. We are very thankful for their gift, without which the team would not have been able to compete. 

This information is current to the 2009 season. Our students will be updating
this to include our 2010 and 2011 season rosters soon.


## Mentors

  * Wayne Penn (Lead Mentor and Drive Coach) 
  * Dan Zaun (Lead Build Mentor) 
  * Mike Siegel (Build Mentor) 
  * David Kohn (Programming Mentor) 
  * Katie Stevens (Alum) 
  * Luke Seale (CAD Jedi; [1717](/index.php/1717 "1717" ) Alum) 

And of course, all of the parents of the team members who contribute to the
team.
