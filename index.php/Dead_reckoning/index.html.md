# Dead reckoning

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Dead reckoning** refers to a [robot](Robot "Robot" ) operating without awareness of how the environment around it is changing. In [FIRST](first), it typically refers to the method of [programming](Programming "Programming" ) the [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ), and generally refers to a robot that does not use any [sensors](sensor) for the autonomous mode. However, that is not entirely accurate. A robot using [encoders](/index.php?title=Encoders&action=edit "Encoders" ) could be considered _dead reckoning_. 

A dead reckoning robot lacks the ability to respond to a changing environment.
However, by not using sensors, dead reckoning robots can operate much faster
and still be consistent (although that could easily be consistently wrong).
