### Regionals

In 2006, I attended the Boilermaker Regional and the Championship Event.

During college, I plan to volunteer at competitions, though I have not yet
decided if I plan to work with a team before I get my bachelor's degree.

## Thoughts on Future

I recently graduated from West Lafayette Jr/Sr High School in West Lafayette,
IN.

I will be attending Northwestern University in Evanston, IL this fall - double
major in Biomedical &amp; Chemical Engineering, with minors in Spanish,
Italian, and Russian.
