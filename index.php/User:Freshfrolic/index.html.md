## Robotics 2006-2007

### Regionals

In 2006, I attended the Boilermaker Regional and the Championship Event.

During college, I plan to volunteer at competitions, though I have not yet decided if I plan to work with a team before I get my bachelor's degree.

### Offseason Competitions

IRI 2006 (July '06) Ra-Cha-Cha Ruckus 2006 (Fall '06)

## Thoughts on Future

I recently graduated from West Lafayette Jr/Sr High School in West Lafayette, IN.

I will be attending Northwestern University in Evanston, IL this fall - double major in Biomedical & Chemical Engineering, with minors in Spanish, Italian, and Russian.
