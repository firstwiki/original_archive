Regarding my rollback of Astro's revisions: We should have articles on [Soldering](Soldering "Soldering") and [Short circuit](Short_circuit "Short circuit") on FIRSTwiki, not on wikipedia. And anyway, we can link wikipedia's articles from our articles. --[SilverStar (Advay)](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar") 16:42, 18 Jun 2004 (EDT)
