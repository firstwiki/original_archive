## History

[[edit](/index.php?title=40&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Team
projects" )]

## Team projects

  * The Robot 
  * Mini FRC 

Using Vex parts, Team 40 sucessfully created six, one-third scale robots for
the 2006 game Aim High. A one-third scale field was also constructed and
brought to the Vex and FRC regional in Hartford, CT, the Championship Event in
Atlanta, GA, BattleCry at WPI, and IRI in Indianapolis. So far this year, the
team has travelled over 5,200 miles with the field. A video of the project can
be found [here](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8078364906389058129
