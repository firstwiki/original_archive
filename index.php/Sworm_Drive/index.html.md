Team 269's 2007 CAD for their gearbox.

Sworm Drive is a drive system developed by team [269](/index.php/269 "269" )
in 2007.

This drive featured a four-wheel worm crab drive with a 15:1 gear ratio. It
was powered by four CIM motors and used a window motor to move the cables in
order to steer. The wheels on this drive system only turned 180 degrees,
making it very difficult to program.

Here you can see an early prototype of [269](/index.php/269 "269" )'s
pioneering drive system.
