Team 269's 2007 CAD for their gearbox.

Sworm Drive is a drive system developed by team [269](269 "269") in 2007.

This drive featured a four-wheel worm crab drive with a 15:1 gear ratio. It was powered by four CIM motors and used a window motor to move the cables in order to steer. The wheels on this drive system only turned 180 degrees, making it very difficult to program.
