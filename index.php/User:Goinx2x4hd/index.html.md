## Home Business Success Can Be Achieved

The majority of entrepreneurs that have attempted a home based business have failed. This is not a big secret. But why is this? Why do only a few succeed when so many more fail? What I have learned is that most of the successful people that you hear about or are introduced to start out as failures themselves. The main difference between a successful person and one that has failed is usually years of experience in the industry vs no experience at all. A new person will get involved with a home business with high expectations of quick and easy success. Well,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), why wouldn't they think this way, it's what they are led to believe. Just get involved and tell people about the opportunity and they will follow. What the failures quickly learn is that it's not quite that simple. The failures are not told that building their business is most likely going to be a long and slow process that's going to actually require some work. They are not told that it is mandatory to develop and learn people and marketing skills. This is the main reason successful people are successful. They have spent years developing these important skills.

Well,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), you may be wondering how does a person without experience stand a chance to succeed in a home business. The truth is that the people and marketing skills are still going to need to be developed and learned. This will take time. Your best chance at success is probably to partner with someone that is willing to work directly with you to build your business while you develop and learn your people and marketing skills. This person should be willing to train and mentor you and teach you how to succeed in the industry.

Before you get involved in any business opportunity,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), make shure you do your research to be certain that the opportunity is legit and has a great track record and choose what you feel that offers the greatest chance of success.

If a person without experience can succeed in finding two key ingredients,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), a mentor and business partner to work with them and a business that they feel good about,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), then their chances of obtaining success goes up dramatically. Be patient and never give up on your dreams. Be persistent and success will eventually follow. Never forget your why and remember that success comes from being in business for the long term.

## How to Choose Eyeglasses for Women

<p> Choosing a pair of eye glasses can be a major decision for many women. Obviously, the proper prescription from your eye doctor is the most important factor and the reason you're wearing eye glasses in the first place. However, after the prescription is taken care of and you can see clearly, several different factors come into play. It's no secret that eye glasses are used as a fashion accessory by both sexes, but for women that connection may be even stronger.

Considering the circumstances that you'll be wearing the glasses in is one factor for choosing the right pair. Many women pick out two or even three different styles of frames for eye glasses, just to suit the different facets of their lives. You may have a job in an office setting and run your kids around to soccer practices or dance classes in the evenings,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), then hit the town with friends a couple times per month. In each situation, you'll wear different clothes, shoes, and possibly a different purse. Wearing different glasses to suit each circumstance helps to put the finishing touch on the whole outfit. Once you've determined how many different styles of eye glasses you may want,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), you can narrow it down further by following a few specific guidelines.

For a woman,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), matching a pair of eye glasses to your skin tone is a good first step. You don't want to pick a pair of eyeglass frames that stand out like a sore thumb on your face,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), but you also don't want to pick frames that just blend in and aren't noticed at all. This is where enlisting the help of your optician is a good idea. She can suggest eye glasses that suit your skin tone the best,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), and will work best for each occasion. The shape of your face is another big consideration when choosing eye glasses for women.

It's important to choose frames that balance the features of your face,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), rather than accentuating one particular feature. As an example, if your face is more of a square shape, choosing square lenses might not make sense. If your face is long, you'd want frames that work to shorten it up. Again, your optician will note the shape of your face and make suggestions to create balance in the overall look.

Once the look of the frames is right from an appearance and fashion standpoint, it's time to tinker with the actual fit. Most pairs of eye glasses can be adjusted for a comfortable fit if they don't fit the way you want. Your optician will look carefully as the glasses are on your face to determine if they are the proper width and sit on the spots they're supposed to sit. You don't want eye glasses that squeeze your nose or temples, and you don't want eye glasses that slide off your nose or are too wide. Since you're supposed to be wearing them to correct your vision, comfort is a big factor for each pair you buy.

## The Bridesmaids Jewelry

One of the most traditional bridesmaids gifts is jewelry. Choosing bridesmaids jewelry depends on the style and color of the maids' dresses, and the theme of the wedding.

If you are a bride and wondering what type of jewelry to pick for your bridesmaids, consider classic pieces. You can never go wrong with a classic jewelry as it is simple, yet elegant. It could be pearl, sterling silver, crystal,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), or rhinestone jewelry. Usually,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), a classic piece of jewelry complements formal dresses and traditional gowns.

Your bridesmaids can look at their best with a pair of classic earrings,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), such as elegant drop style earrings, crystal; silver; or pearl stud earrings,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), dangle ropes, or small silver hoops. Select a moderate length of drop or dangle styled earrings rather than selecting gaudy ones. Their moderate size will keep them eye-catching and attractive while in their classic outfit.

If you are looking for another piece of classic jewelry for each of your bridesmaids, consider simple pearl chokers, a nice strand of pearls, or simple silver chains. These would make lovely accessories to accentuate the bridesmaids' traditional attire. For charming alternatives, you may go for a pearl, crystal or other charm necklaces. Remember that the neckline of the bridesmaids' dresses is a major deciding factor when choosing bridesmaids necklaces. For example, a short strand of pearls will look best for a bridesmaid dress with a squared neckline.

Aside from necklaces and earrings, you might also want to give each of your bridesmaids a matching bracelet. Bridesmaids bracelets come in a wide variety of classic styles as well. If you want pieces that are pretty and have a feminine touch, consider vine style bracelets. While charm bracelets with their engraved names or initials can make a thoughtful keepsake for them. Bracelets usually work well with sleeveless gowns and dresses, or outfits with cap, short, or sheer sleeves. Just forgo the bracelets if your bridesmaids will be wearing full sleeved dresses.

If your wedding is more of a modern style,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), you might want to skip classic touches on your bridesmaids jewelry. You may consider pretty pink coral earrings and necklaces, delicate anklets,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), or chunky seashell bracelets if you are planning a beach wedding. For an outdoor or garden wedding, consider jewelry pieces with floral designs, or pieces in soft pastels or bright colors. Swarorvski jewelry is also a contemporary option. Another alternative is a handmade jewelry that is individually designed for each bridesmaid. Handmade pieces are something that your wedding attendants can really treasure and cherish for years to come. They can also make unique bridesmaids gifts that are truly made for your friends only.

You can find a much wider selection for bridesmaids jewelry and other bridal jewelry online. Some of the most popular bridesmaids gifts these days are engraved pieces. Usually, names, initials or a monogram are engraved on the surface of the jewelry. Aside from these stunning items, you can also find other more personalized bridesmaids gifts that are unique and sure to impress your lovely wedding attendants.Related Theme Articles:

## Viral Marketing Will Not Infect Your Computer

<p> Viral Marketing has got nothing to do with viruses. It's also known as viral advertising and is used to increase the profile of your product or company by spreading your information by word of mouth.

This can now be done via social media like facebook and twitter,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), or through forums and email,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), because of the digital world we live in.

When a popular video is posted on YouTube,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), it's a very good example of something being spread virally. because everybody passes along to their friends before you know it,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), it's been seen by thousands of people, and everyone is talking about it.

It can be a very smart way to generate traffic but it shouldn't be your only means of generating traffic. You're getting other people to spread the word about your product, and from what they tell other people you get traffic back to your website.

One of the main reasons it is so effective is because it's very cheap to setup. You only have to promote it once and then it gets spread like a virus - it is passed onto a friend,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), they pass onto several others, they pass onto a few others and so on.

In order to have an effective viral marketing campaign there's a few things that you need to do.

Your product first of all needs to be easy to explain. It should be possible to explain it in a few words - Imagine if it took 10 minutes when someone sat and explained it to you. You wouldn't be interested in passing it on as you would start to lose interest very quickly.

It also has to be easy to use and this means it should be uncomplicated. People will stop using it and not spread your message if it's at all complicated. All someone needs to do is share the link with their friends and then they share with their friends and then it spreads like wildfire, which is another reason why videos spread virally on the Internet.

Another thing a viral product needs is a coolness factor. People just won't tell other people about it if they don't like using it or if youe product isn't cool. How do you think iPhone's became so popular - a lot of their popularity came from word-of-mouth. You'll find it's far easier to get people to tell their friends about it,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), if your product is fun to use and this will make your viral marketing campaign much more successful and effective.

------------------------------

One of the best ways of spreading a product virally is by including something clever or unexpected in it. It may make a user smile (there's the fun bit again) making them want to pass it on to their friends. One of the most clever examples I've seen of viral marketing can be found at this link:<br>

## Vers un encadrement des rémunérations, quelques pistes - L

Les récents scandales autour des rémunérations des grands patrons ont mis en évidence l'ampleur des avantages salariaux et des parachutes dorés dont ont bénéficié certains dirigeants de grandes sociétés. Comment parvenir à un meilleur contrôle des rémunérations ?<p>1\. Améliorer les principes du gouvernement d'entreprise

Une voie possible est d'améliorer l'effectivité des principes du gouvernement d'entreprise auxquels les rémunérations de toute nature doivent répondre.

Pour Yann Paclot, professeur de droit à l'université Paris-Sud et spécialiste des questions de rémunérations, les pistes d'un meilleur contrôle des rémunérations passent par "une plus grande indépendance des conseils d'administration ou de surveillance vis-à-vis des dirigeants et un renforcement des moyens accordés aux membres de ces conseils. Plus de moyens d'investigation et de contrôle, mais aussi plus de moyens financiers,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), de manière à ce que les membres des conseils puissent consacrer plus de temps à leur mandat". Selon lui, l'indépendance des membres de ces organes est "essentielle, l'impartialité est primordiale". Elle permettra également une plus grande transparence des rémunérations.

Les limites

La proportion d'administrateurs indépendants  c'est-à-dire qui n'entretiennent "aucune relation de quelque nature que ce soit avec la société, son groupe ou sa direction" (définition de Daniel Bouton, PDG de la Société générale) , selon le cabinet de conseil en recherche des dirigeants Korn/Ferry International, augmente lentement, mais les pratiques en matière de rémunérations restent encore largement fondées sur la "consanguinité", les comités de rémunérations étant souvent réservés à une élite limitée, qui a fait les mêmes grandes écoles, et qui cumule les mandats dans les conseils d'administration des grandes sociétés. L'évolution sera donc lente.

Colette Neuville, présidente de l'Association de défense des actionnaires minoritaires, souligne que "l'expérience montre que ces mesures ne sont pas suffisantes pour éviter les scandales. C'est aux actionnaires de fixer les principes de rémunération des dirigeants, pas aux administrateurs, même indépendants, choisis par les PDG".

2\. Plafonner les rémunérations

Pour d'autres, il faudrait plafonner les rémunérations, ou tout au moins réduire les écarts entre celles des patrons et celles des salariés de l'entreprise. Pierre-Henri Leroy, président du cabinet de conseil Proxinvest, recommande que la rémunération totale d'un patron du CAC 40 "ne puisse pas être supérieure à 240 fois le smic, soit 100 fois la rémunération moyenne dans les entreprises du CAC 40". "Cela fait tout de même 3,5 millions d'euros. On vit bien avec cela ,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/")!", souligne-t-il. Dans l'esprit de Pierre-Henri Leroy, cette somme comprendrait la valeur estimée des stock- options et des actions gratuites attribuées pour l'année considérée, ce qui diminuerait fortement les revenus des grands patrons.

Pierre Bilger, ancien patron d'Alstom, estime plutôt qu'"il faut faire en sorte que l'on maintienne un écart raisonnable entre les rémunérations des PDG et celles de leurs principaux collaborateurs". "Cet écart ne devrait pas dépasser 50 %. Il est clair que si l'on s'orientait dans cette direction, la plupart des scandales dont on parle n'auraient pas existé",[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), insiste-t-il.

Les limites

De telles mesures seraient populaires, mais il n'est pas certain qu'elles pourraient être efficaces et surtout réalistes. D'abord, on peut remarquer que le salaire cumulé des patrons du CAC 40 ne représente qu'un montant très faible de la masse salariale. En 2005, le total des salaires versés aux PDG du CAC 40 atteignait 95 millions d'euros, ce qui apparaît relativement faible par rapport aux 85 milliards d'euros de bénéfices de ces sociétés. Répartir les salaires des grands patrons n'aurait donc qu'un faible effet redistributif sur les salariés de ces entreprises. D'autre part,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), il est peu probable que l'on parvienne à limiter les rémunérations des grands patrons,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), même si on le souhaitait. Dans une économie libérale, cela paraît difficile. En effet, une solution autoritaire pour fixer un niveau de rémunération se heurterait à la mobilité du capital international et aux possibilités de délocalisation faciles pour les multinationales. D'ailleurs, le versement des indemnités à M. Forgeard pouvait-il être empêché ? Même si la législation française avait été stricte en la matière, c'est loin d'être certain, car EADS est une société de droit néerlandais, un droit très libéral en matière de rémunérations. Ce qui montre que les dirigeants peuvent bénéficier des législations les plus avantageuses en Europe. Dans ce contexte, aucun pays n'a pris de mesures pour limiter les rémunérations des grands patrons ou interdire les parachutes dorés, conscient de leur inutilité et de leur inefficacité.

3\. Mieux fixer les règles du jeu

Patrick Bonazza, rédacteur en chef du service Economie du magazine Le Point, propose plusieurs solutions dans son ouvrage Les Goinfres. Enquête sur l'argent des grands patrons français. Elles reprennent en partie les pistes précédentes. Patrick Bonazza édicte plusieurs règles. Règle numéro un : ne pas récompenser l'échec ; un patron qui a failli "ne doit pas toucher un kopeck". Règle numéro deux : ne pas déconnecter les gains du PDG de ce qu'il fait réellement pour l'entreprise ; ainsi faudrait-il supprimer les retraites chapeaux. "Pourquoi l'entreprise devrait-elle payer pour quelqu'un qui ne lui apporte plus rien ?", s'interroge Patrick Bonazza. Règle numéro trois : jouer la clarté. "Maintenir le flou dans les rémunérations est un sport qui fait des ravages dans les états-majors." Ainsi,"le bonus de Zacharias [ancien PDG de Vinci] dépendait d'un nombre invraisemblable de critères". Il faut revenir à des critères d'établissement des rémunérations plus précis et moins nombreux. Enfin, autre règle proposée : éviter de surpayer le succès d'un grand patron.

Les limites

Ces pistes sont intéressantes. Mais elles s'opposent aux intérêts des grands patrons et aussi des administrateurs qui déterminent ou adoptent les rémunérations des grands patrons la plupart du temps sans discussion, tant les liens sont forts et tant ils forment une élite qui s'autorégule.

La loi,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), comme on l'a vu récemment, peut accélérer les choses en favorisant, par exemple, une plus grande objectivité des critères de rémunération ; elle ne pourra pas imposer un plafond de salaire sans effet contre-productif au détriment de l'économie française.

Des tirs d'arme lourde ont été entendus dans la matinée de mercredi 20 mars à Abidjan,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), dans le quartier de Yopougon (ouest), où les forces du président ivoirien Alassane Ouattara tentent de déloger des miliciens favorables à l'ex-chef d'Etat Laurent Gbagbo,[burberry outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), ont rapporté des habitants.

"Depuis 4 heures du matin,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), on entend des tirs d'arme lourde, de fortes détonations. On a été obligés de fuir le quartier très tôt",[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), a déclaré à l'AFP un résident du secteur baptisé "Koweït", dans le sud du quartier. "Un soldat des FRCI (Forces républicaines de M. Ouattara) nous a dit qu'ils sont venus déloger les miliciens libériens pro-Gbagbo qui sont encore cachés dans certains coins de Yopougon", a indiqué un autre habitant.

Depuis l'arrestation de M. Gbagbo le 11 avril,[burberry outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), les FRCI ont progressivement pris le contrôle de la capitale économique mais affrontent encore des miliciens dans le quartier de Yopougon, fief historique de l'ancien chef d'Etat.

## Who Can You Partner With

Who Can You Partner With to do a joint venture or earn affiliate commissions?

Do you have friends or peers that do regular promotions with complimentary businesses or maybe they earn additional income by referring certain companies or products?

This is what I'm referring to here.

First, if you're thinking "but I can't do that with my business" or some other negative thought is crossing your mind - GET RID OF IT! Every single person (not even business owner) can make money some how this way.

On the other hand, if you're saying "I already do this", well then GREAT! But...I'll bet you aren't doing as much as you could be doing, right? And that's probably due to lack of time right?

So, I challenge you this week to take 2 steps:<br>
1\. Make a list like the one I did below for myself as to all the people you could potentially outsource to,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), refer business to and also those who it would make sense that they referred back to you. Only list the obvious-type partners, not random businesses that you want; they need to have a similar target market as you do for this to work and be a true WIN-WIN situation.<br>
2\. Take this list of industries,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), types of companies, etc. and then go into your database first to see who YOU know that fits these categories. After that, go to your membership organizations, etc. and look for others in your local area and then online too. Build a big 'prospect list' so to speak of everyone you would love to collaborate with and then start calling them and emailing them asking them to chat about the opportunities available to you both.<br>
The more you do this,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), the more opportunities will open up to you, you'll see. But make sure you're intention is to make it a WIN-WIN or it won't work ok?

Here is a list of other industries you might want to check into as joint venture opportunities for your company.

## Factbox AIG's Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life

<p>n">(Reuters) - American International Group Inc has accepted a $2.16 billion offer for its Taiwan Nan Shan Life unit from a group led by local conglomerate Ruentex Group.,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com")

Following are some facts about Nan Shan:

-- Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), behind the life insurance units of financial holding firms Cathay Financial and Fubon Financial.

-- Founded in 1963, Nan Shan has 4 million policy holders,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), or about one- sixth of Taiwan's 23 million population. Its assets were T$1.7 trillion ($53 billion) as of June 2010.

-- Nan Shan lost T$12.5 billion in the third quarter of last year and T$12.7 billion in the second. For the full year of 2009,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), the firm reported a net profit of T$10.6 billion.

-- Nan Shan has about 30,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"),000 sales agents, one of the largest numbers in the local insurance industry. The huge sales force had become a burden for AIG,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), in part because of union demands that all the different types of employee pensions were protected.

-- AIG put Nan Shan up for sale in 2009 as part of efforts to raise cash and repay the U.S. government for its bailout.

-- Taiwan's regulators rejected an original bid by Hong Kong-listed battery maker China Strategic and Hong Kong investment firm Primus because the two did not meet criteria on experience in the insurance business and ability to raise funds for future operations.

-- That deal had sparked protests from politicians and unions over the buyer group's political connections with mainland China and over fears jobs would be cut.

## Snap Analysis The long arm of the U.S. healthcare ruling

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court ruling to uphold the core of President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law on Thursday has wide-ranging political and economic implications.

Here is a snap analysis of what it means for Americans, healthcare providers, insurers, the law and the presidential campaign.

How does the ruling affect the average American?

- Working families with annual household incomes up to nearly $90,000 will be able to purchase private insurance through new state insurance markets at prices subsidized according to income level,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), beginning in 2014\. But people with household incomes of around $29,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"),000, who qualify for coverage under the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor, may have to wait for their respective state governments to decide whether they will join the program's huge expansion. Preventive healthcare measures including mammograms and other cancer screenings will be available without deductibles or co-pays. Adult children up to age 26 can remain on their parents' health insurance plans. Senior citizens can expect to continue receiving discounts on prescription drugs aimed at closing the Medicare coverage gap known as the "doughnut hole." Health insurers will continue to pay rebates on premiums not sufficiently targeted at healthcare services. Beginning in 2014,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage to adults with pre-existing medical conditions and would be required to stop or curb discriminatory pricing based on gender, age and health status.

What about healthcare providers?

- The ruling removes one cloud of uncertainty over the future of healthcare reform and would help the administration's efforts to implement it fully by January 1,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), 2014, when the law is scheduled to go into effect. Under the decision, physicians and hospitals continue to move away from the traditional fee-for-service healthcare business model and toward more efficient systems that coordinate care. For healthcare providers, the affirmation represents millions of potential new patients, either through private plans or the government's Medicaid program for the poor. Some, however, would be under added pressure to enact more savings, which could cut into revenues. The administration still faces some fairly tall hurdles, such as establishing regulated health insurance markets in all 50 states so consumers can purchase subsidized coverage. Up until now,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), over a dozen states have done little or nothing to create such exchanges, partly because of the uncertainty over the fate of the law. Down the road, if Republicans succeed in taking control of the White House and the Senate in November (they already control the House of Representatives), they would likely try to repeal the law in 2013.

Where does the ruling leave health insurers?

- The health insurance industry can expect premium revenue from millions of new, healthy customers through state exchanges. But the industry will also have to operate with new consumer protections that require coverage access for people with pre-existing medical conditions and other health status issues, and mandate preventive care without customary charges.

How might the ruling influence the presidential campaign?

- This is a big victory for Obama, who has weathered years of criticism from conservatives about his reforms. The decision could energize the president and his supporters,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), while undercutting presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who introduced similar reforms as Massachusetts governor but opposes their use as national policy. But there could be a silver lining for Republicans: the opinion could light a fire under party candidates and constituents who want a president who would repeal the law in 2013.

## PetroChina pays $5.4 billion for Canadian gas assets

CALGARY, Alberta/HONG KONG (Reuters) - PetroChina is purchasing half of a prolific shale gas project from Canada's Encana Corp for C$5.4 billion ($5.4 billion), marking the largest Chinese investment yet in a foreign natural gas asset.

Chinese companies such as PetroChina and CNOOC have been scouring globally for unconventional gas assets to reduce reliance on coal and satisfy its energy hunger to fuel its economy, now the world's second-largest.

In January,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), CNOOC struck a $570 million shale deal with U.S. natural gas company Chesapeake Energy Corp, its second such deal with the American company in about four months.

On Thursday, shares of PetroChina, Asia's largest oil and gas producer, fell more than 2 percent in Hong Kong trade, lagging the Hang Seng's 0.7 percent fall, as analysts said the deal, to be paid all in cash, was pricey. Encana shares closed down 60 Canadian cents, or 2 percent, at C$30.65 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It announced the deal after the market closed.

"Not too dissimilar to the CNOOC/Chesapeake deals, the PetroChina/Encana tie- up is another win-win that enables China to acquire quick exposure to the long term shale oil/gas boom in North America," said Gordon Kwan, an analyst with Mirae Asset Management in Hong Kong.

Kwan said the deal will also allow Chinese companies like PetroChina to migrate the technology back to China for its development in domestic unconventional oil and gas resources.

LITTLE THREAT FROM POLITICS

Encana,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), one of the North America's largest gas producers,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), and state-owned PetroChina agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture to develop the Cutbank Ridge lands in the westernmost province of British Columbia over several years.

The deal, which is subject to approval by the Canadian and Chinese governments,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), came after nine months of talks,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), both companies said.

The venture will allow Encana to accelerate development of its vast reserves while keeping a lid on capital investments at a time when natural gas markets are weak. For the Chinese, it's another step toward the country's goal of tripling the use of the lower-carbon fuel over the next decade.

The venture is likely to go ahead without much political fanfare as the purchase of a 50 percent stake in the Canadian firm's unconventional gas assets was not nearly as threatening as an outright acquisition.

"You can't guarantee it is going to go ahead but I think it is quite likely. These guys are more than happy to take a few billion dollars in there, that is ultimately what it is all about," said Brynjar Bustnes, analyst at JP Morgan in Hong Kong.

The value of the deal surpasses PetroChina's $3.1 billion joint bid with Royal Dutch Shell to buy Australia's coal-seam gas player Arrow Energy last year.

It is also worth more than the largest previous Canadian energy buy, Sinopec Corp's $4.65 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' stake in the Syncrude Canada oil sands venture.

"It looks expensive to us," said Neil Beveridge, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong.

"If you look at the proven reserves that PetroChina are getting it is one trillion cubic feet of gas for $5.4 billion, so it looks to be about $5.40 per mscf (million cubic feet) on the current proven reserves which looks to be expensive."

The deal has been so priced even as North American gas prices are languishing under the weight of high inventories and the potential production that new technology has opened up in hard-to-reach shale formations.

The price tag represents 3.8 percent of Encana's 2010 estimated production for 24 percent of its market capitalization.

"This is an outstanding valuation for Encana," CIBC World Markets analyst Andrew Potter said.

Cutbank Ridge,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), comprising 635,000 net acres in northeastern British Columbia, currently produces 255 million cubic feet of gas a day from proved reserves of about 1 trillion cubic feet.

## Instant view Azumi to be Japan finance minister

TOKYO (Reuters) - Jun Azumi, a former parliamentary affairs chief for the ruling Democratic Party, will become Japan's new finance minister, local media reported, after new Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's first choice for the job reportedly turned it down.

Azumi will take charge of Japan's currency and fiscal policies at a time when the world's third-biggest economy grapples with the yen's sharp appreciation and a public debt twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.

KEY POINTS

-- The lineup of the new cabinet is expected to be announced on Friday by Yoshihiko Noda, 54,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), who was voted in by parliament as prime minister this week,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), becoming the nation's sixth leader in five years.

-- Noda, himself finance minister from June 2010 in the previous administration, backed a government proposal to double the 5 percent sales tax by the middle of the decade to fund bulging social security costs and curb massive public debt.

-- Katsuya Okada, a fiscal hawk who held the party's No.2 post, turned down Noda's request to take over the crucial financial portfolio,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), public broadcaster NHK reported earlier.

COMMENTARY

AYAKO SERA,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), MARKET ECONOMIST, SUMITOMO TRUST AND BANKING, TOKYO

"He (Azumi) has not made many comments about intervention or fiscal policies so his basic policy stance is not clear.

The key would be how well he could manage and work with the bureaucrats because of the friction the party has created with bureaucrats. Azumi has appeared on media and leaves an impression as a very intelligent person, so there is a risk that he might pursue his own path without sufficiently consulting others."

JESPER KOLL, DIRECTOR OF EQUITIES RESEARCH AT JPMORGAN, TOKYO

"Noda's strong hold is the finance ministry. Assuming he is going to leverage that, no politician wants the job because fiscal, budget and tax policy are going to be led by the prime minister. Whomever Noda nominates,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), the finance minister will likely be a 'yes-man' for Mr Noda."

BACKGROUND

-- Noda has said Japan will need to raise taxes temporarily to help pay for rebuilding from the devastating March 11 tsunami. But he has grown more cautious about the timing of any rises,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), saying economic growth and fiscal reform are both vital.

-- Noda has promised firm steps including intervention against excessive and rapid currency moves and wants to work closely with the Bank of Japan.

-- The new administration will have to cope with a resurgent yen that threatens exports, forge a new energy policy while ending the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.

-- The Democrats swept to power two years ago promising to change how Japan is ruled. But the party quickly lost momentum, dogged by internal divisions and a hung parliament as its novice team confronted the global financial crisis. The March disaster left 20,000 dead or missing and has pushed the economy back into recession.

-- Moody's Investors Service cut Japan's sovereign credit rating on August 24 citing a buildup of public debt and a lack of leadership and a long-term strategy to cope with its fiscal challenges.

## Japan's Hoya to sell Pentax camera business to Ricoh

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese optical glass-maker Hoya said on Friday it would sell its Pentax camera business to copier and printer maker Ricoh,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), in a deal the Nikkei business daily said was worth about 10 billion yen ($124.2 million).

Battling falling prices for its compact cameras, Ricoh hopes to establish a presence in the profitable upmarket single-lens reflex camera segment,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), the Nikkei business daily said.

The two companies will hold a news conference about the transaction at 0730 GMT.

The deal will go through in October,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), Hoya said in a filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Shares in Hoya ended up 4 percent at 1,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"),845 yen, after climbing as high as 6 percent to 1,888 yen on the news, while Ricoh was down 0.2 percent,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), in a broader market climb of 0.5 percent.

Hoya, which bought Pentax in 2007 mainly to gain access to its medical technology, had been widely expected to sell off the camera business.

Pentax is the world's tenth largest digital camera brand by shipments, with just 1.5 percent of the market, according to research firm IDC.

Sales of Pentax cameras dropped just over 13 percent in the year ended March 2011,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), amid fierce price competition in the compact camera market.

Copier and printer-maker Ricoh, which aims to shed nearly 10 percent of its workforce to improve profits, also has a digital camera business, but sales are too small to feature in global data.

## Instant view July core producer prices accelerate

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. core producer prices rose at their fastest pace in six months in July, pushed up by higher tobacco and light truck costs, according to a government report on Wednesday that could stoke inflation fears.

COMMENTS:

MICHAEL GAPEN, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK

"It was above expectations. It was an upside surprise. We were looking for a drop off in the energy component. We had expected that to be offset by higher food prices and light vehicle prices.

"This continues to show pipeline pressure across many consumer goods. We have seen these pressures for some time. We have seen these reports several times before when they are stronger than forecast. We have seen some pass-throughs, but given the state of the economy and lack of pricing power by the corporate sector,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), we haven't seen a full pass-through. Margins will likely be pressured among firms, which could affect earnings growth."

BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK

"The only way we can be only modestly confident about this is if it shows up tomorrow in the CPI. The big question is do producers have the power to pass on prices to consumers, and I think that's doubtful. There's so much liquidity sloshing around so there's a bit of upward pressure on wholesale prices, but in the grander scheme of things, inflation remains a very distant problem for the Fed. I think the Fed even desires a bit of inflation."

EUGENIO ALEMAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO, CHARLOTTE,[burberry outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), NC

"It was a little bit stronger than expected but it comes from a very deep drop in the previous month. There was a revision on the numbers that might have also affected the seasonally adjusted numbers. The story is that prices are increasing, which is good in the sense that this is what the Federal Reserve wants.

(HOW IT AFFECTS CHANCES OF QE3)

"It's too difficult to know. there is a strong opposition within the Federal Reserve to approve a QE3 now. They are in a very difficult position because they have been trying to reinflate the economy. The economy is inflating but growth is not happening. We could be at the doors of another stagflation -- no growth and inflation."

IAN LYNGEN, SENIOR GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGIST,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), CRT CAPITAL GROUP,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT

"Overall, the PPI release challenges the Fed's notion that inflation pressures are moderating, although we'll stress that today's release will not likely change the market's expectations for tomorrow's more policy relevant CPI release.

"As expected, the Treasury market is not taking much direction from the release, trading down slightly immediately following the release, but has returned to pre-release levels -- off modestly from yesterday's closes."

DAVID SLOAN,[burberry outlet online](<http://www.outle>
tbags2012.com/ "<http://www.outletbags2012.com/>" ), ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS

"It is possible to identify special factors that pushed the core rate above trend,[burberry outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), and there are good reasons to expect inflationary pressures to fade in the months ahead. However, with the core PPI still in a clear underlying uptrend, the strength of this number cannot be fully dismissed. Growth risks may lie on the downside, but it is less clear that price risks also do."

# Newfound optimism could extend to earnings season

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market is riding a wave of renewed optimism and investors looking for a reason other than Europe to keep buying may find it in earnings.

The European debt crisis and worries about U.S. growth pressured the market greatly in recent months. Since hitting 13-month lows last week, though, stocks have rallied sharply, putting bullish investors back in the driver's seat as shorts scramble to cover big bets.

This feel good mood may not be over.

The market's lousy psychology for most of the past two months -- built on expectations for poor economic growth and a worsening euro-zone crisis -- could mean investors are still expecting disappointments. Such cautious expectations might end up helping stocks if results are not dismal.

"I think the worst-case scenario has already been built into these stocks because of Europe,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/")," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), Vermont.

The earnings period is due to kick off on Tuesday, when Alcoa is due to report after the market's close. Google and JPMorgan Chase are expected to report on Thursday.

Analysts' forecasts for S&P 500 companies' profits have come down slightly in recent weeks. They expect a rise in profits of 12.6 percent compared with the third quarter a year ago. On July 1 their forecast was for 17 percent growth, Thomson Reuters data showed.

Given the big losses stocks have seen recently, gains could actually be in store for the market, some analysts argue. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index is down roughly 10 percent since the beginning of the third quarter.

"We're of the belief that when we get some news out, the market's reaction is probably going to be positive just due to the fact that we've clearly priced in a lot of pessimism," said Thomas Villalta, portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Asset Management in Austin, Texas.

VALUATIONS STILL COMPELLING

Investors have worried that the European debt and U.S. growth problems, as well as possibly less-robust expansion in China, hurt third-quarter results. With recent U.S. economic data coming in better than expected,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), it has given investors hope that company results will be strong enough to bolster stock prices.

Unlike the euro-zone crisis, a vast problem that causes investors to respond mostly at an emotional level, earnings reports allow for direct comparisons to current market valuations. And by many measures, stocks are relatively cheap.

The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P, that is, a measure of the price paid for a share relative to the company's profit,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), is low by historical standards. The S&P 500's forward P/E of 10.8 is at its lowest in roughly 10 years.

"Even if the earnings deteriorate somewhat, you're still in a good area," said Standard & Poor's analyst Howard Silverblatt.

The third quarter is still on track to be the second-highest earnings period, in dollar terms, on record after the second quarter,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), Silverblatt said.

Thomson Reuters estimates third-quarter earnings will total $230 billion.

Sectors expected to see the biggest growth are energy and materials,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), with gold repeatedly hitting records in recent months and oil at historically high levels, Thomson Reuters data showed.

"There's a lot of a cushion already built into the average stock to compensate for a variance in earnings plus or minus," said Mendelsohn.

Mike Jackson, founder of Denver-based investment firm T3 Equity Labs, sees a high probability of an earnings upside surprise this reporting period.

In terms of sectors, he puts industrials on top in terms of the potential for an upside earnings surprise, followed by utilities, financials, consumer staples and information technology.

"You've got the true driver of the market (earnings) continuing to go forward and the market going south. That's unusual," he said. "There's a fairly good chance of surprise at the index level and at the sector level."

# Greek bond swap falling short, governments may fill gap sou

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Talks about private sector creditors paying for part of a second Greek bailout are going badly, senior European bankers said on Wednesday, raising the prospect that euro zone governments will have to increase their contribution to the aid package.

"Governments are mulling an increase of their share of the burden,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/")," said one of the bankers,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), who is familiar with the talks.

An IMF source told Reuters if the deal with private bondholders does not help reduce Greece's debt, then Europeans would have to provide more financing for the next rescue package or the IMF may be unwilling to commit more money for Athens.

Banks and investment funds have been negotiating with Athens for months on a bond swap scheme to cut Greece's debt burden from 160 percent of the nation's annual output to a more manageable 120 percent by 2020\. This is central to a second, 130 billion euro ($165 billion) bailout that international lenders have drawn up to help the country avert default.

As part of these talks, banks have agreed to a "voluntary" 50 percent write- down on Greek debt holdings but have faced demands to make further concessions, a factor that has made it less attractive for some of the investors to take part on a voluntary basis.

The participation rate among private sector investors is currently less than 75 percent, which means Greece's debt will be reduced by far less than expected, the source said.

Asked whether governments will have to put up more cash to make up for such a shortfall, another senior banker said: "Nothing is decided yet, but the bigger the imposed haircut,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), the less appetite there is for voluntary conversion."

A third senior banker, who was asked the same question, said: "Private sector involvement is going badly."

There are suggestions in euro zone government circles that ministers are realizing they may need to bolster the planned second bailout if the voluntary bond swap scheme falls short of expectations.

Stumping up yet more money would be politically difficult in Germany and other countries in the northern part of the currency bloc.

An Athens-based source close to the talks on private sector involvement (PSI) insisted: "The government is pushing hard and is close to signing a deal." But the source declined to give an indication about take-up.

German newspaper Handelsblatt said in a preview of a story to be published on Thursday that according to IMF calculations, there was a hole in the "significant tens of billions" in the Greek aid package that would have to be plugged.

MERKEL,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), SARKOZY INSIST

On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy insisted private-sector bondholders must share in reducing Greece's debt burden and said no further aid would flow to Athens without a deal.

Banks and other private sector creditors attempted to agree a deal before Christmas to cut the value of their bonds by half in return for a mix of cash and new bonds.

But the talks hit trouble over the details of the debt swap such as the coupon, maturity and the credit guarantees. These will determine the bonds' Net Present Value (NPV),[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), and thereby the actual hit the banks need to take.

Policymakers insist agreement is near despite weeks of talks already. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday negotiators were "about to finalise shortly".

Athens needs to conclude the deal and secure funding from its euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund to be able to redeem 14.5 billion euros of maturing bonds on March 20\. [ID:nL6E8CA3I3]. A deal needs to come well before that, because the paperwork alone takes at least six weeks.

Hedge funds who have picked up Greek debt are intent on staying out of the bond swap deal, sources say. They either prefer letting the country go under, which would trigger the credit insurance they have bought, or hope to get paid out in full if enough others sign up.

But Athens could change its laws and impose Collective Action Clauses which would force all creditors to sign up to the bond swap if a clear majority had voluntarily done so.

Charles Dallara, the head of a group representing private-sector banks, will hold talks in Athens on Thursday with Greek government officials on a voluntary swap of privately held Greek bonds, a spokesman for Dallara's Institute of International Finance said.

According to a weekend report in German magazine Der Spiegel, the IMF believes Greece will still be sinking under the burden of its debts even after a bond swap deal is struck, and that further measures may need to be taken if the country is to avoid default.

# Moody's keeps negative outlook on Japan, watching developmen

TOKYO (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service is maintaining a negative outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating and watching developments,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), its senior vice-president Tom Byrne said on Wednesday.

Byrne made the remarks after S&P lowered the outlook for Japan's sovereign rating to negative on Wednesday,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), saying the earthquake,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), tsunami and nuclear power plant disaster will increase Japan's fiscal deficits above previous estimates.

"The bottom line is we are maintaining a negative outlook and watching developments,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/")," Byrne told Reuters in an interview. "We are interested in the bottom line,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), that's the rating bottom line -- the government fiscal deficit and government debt."

Moody's warned in February it might cut Japan's Aa2 rating -- its third highest -- if government policies fall short of comprehensive tax reform.

Byrne said the most immediate concern has not changed since then, which is to see if the government can come up with comprehensive programs in June to bring huge public debt under control in a fast-aging society.

Japan's debt trajectory has been bumped upwards and its deficit will be greater in fiscal 2011/12 than the government had anticipated in the wake of the March 11 earthquake, Byrne said.

But it was not great enough to prompt any immediate negative rating action,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/"), he said.

Byrne expects the government to use a combination of a shift in spending cuts and tax rises to fund the cost of reconstruction.

"The bottom line is what the government deficit will be and how that will contribute to government debt."

# The Secret To MLM Advertising That Brings Giant Results

Lots of networkers have a giant puzzle they can't solve - and that is advertising their MLM business. The problem arises from two main factors. First, there is tough competition nowadays in the network marketing arena. When you advertise in any of the industry magazines,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), or in one of the major search engines like Google and Yahoo,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), you will notice that the market is already bombarded with similar marketing messages. How on earth can a network marketing professional get noticed in this sea of competitive advertisers who also want to promote their respective business opportunities?

The second conflict arises from the budget required for advertising your networking business. Because of the tough competition mentioned above, there is a natural increase in ad rates. Buying full page ad positions in popular network marketing magazines is no longer as affordable as before. And Google pay-per-click rates have outrageously risen to almost insurmountable rates that only the "top players" can afford to maneuver their way through it. Unless you have a definite plan that works towards helping you get a decent return on your investment,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), you will lose big money.

So how can an MLM winner and high flyer like you solve the problems we discussed above? I have developed a simple promotional system for myself, and I've used it to bring hundreds of people to my downline in the past two years. The key is to minimize (and even erase) your advertising costs by front-end selling. The way to do this is to first sell an affordable (almost no cost) info product that caters specifically to the needs of youre target crowd, without having to bombard them with details of your multilevel program.

The cheap product must contain some information that is extremely useful to your target audience, must help their current needs,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), and make them want to come back for more. The money generated by cheap product sales can then be reinvested back into advertising purposes. This will initiate a continuous flow of cash and activity in your MLM biz. Plus, you'll generate many business leads in the process so you can later show them your opportunity.

I call this process the "backdoor cashflow mechanism" because it doesn't pressure people to join a business opportunity. Alternatively, you gain competitive advantage by genuinely helping prospects get more information as such as affordable value. The moment they buy from you,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), rapport is built, and the likelihood of a long term business relationship goes up.

# Economic growth gauge falls to six-week low ECRI

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - A measure of future U.S. economic growth fell to a six-week low in the latest week,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), while the index's annualized growth rate rose to an 18-week high,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), a research group said on Friday.

The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), said its Weekly Leading Index fell to 122.1 in the week ended October 15 from 122.2 the previous week.

That was the lowest since September 3, when it stood at 121.9.

The index's annualized growth rate rose to minus 6.8 percent from minus 7.0 percent a week earlier. That was the highest since June 11,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), when it stood at minus 6.1 percent.

Occasionally the index level and growth rate can move in different directions,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), because the growth rate is derived from a four-week moving average,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), the research institute said.

# Chronology Federal Reserve's transparency steps

n">(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve this week will begin publishing forecasts for short-term U.S. interest rates and the expected timing of its next rate hike.,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")

The forecasts, to be released at the close of the Fed's policy-setting panel's meeting on Wednesday,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), are seen as a significant step toward greater transparency. The U.S. central bank may also move to set a formal inflation target.

The following are some of the other main strides the Fed has taken toward greater openness since 1994:

February 1994 - The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins to release statements announcing moves in the overnight federal funds rate,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), its main policy tool.

February 1995 - The FOMC decides to issue "lightly edited" verbatim transcripts of deliberations with a five-year lag.

August 1997 - The Fed publicly acknowledges policy is formulated in terms of a target for the federal funds rate. The FOMC begins to put a number on the intended federal funds rate in its policy-implementing directive to the New York Fed.

December 1998 - The FOMC adopts a policy of immediately communicating a major change in its views on the likely direction of monetary policy. The first announced bias shift was in May 1999\. It has issued a statement after every meeting since then,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), whether or not it has changed rates or shifted its bias.

December 1999 - The FOMC adopts a new procedure on issuing assessments of balance of economic risks, instead of policy bias. The statement issued after the February 2000 FOMC meeting was the first with the new balance of risks language.

March 2002 - The FOMC adopts policy of immediately announcing whether there were any dissenting votes. Previously the roll-call vote was disclosed only when the meeting's minutes were released.

July 2004 - The Fed begins to provide a forecast for core inflation,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), in addition to overall inflation,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), in its semiannual monetary policy reports to Congress. Fed officials generally focus more heavily on core inflation measures.

December 2004 - The FOMC decides to accelerate the release of its meetings' minutes by making them public three weeks after each gathering as opposed to after the subsequent meeting, a lag of about six weeks.

February 2005 - The Fed provides two-year forecasts from policymakers in its February monetary policy report to Congress. Previously, the February report contained only forecasts for the current year.

November 2007 - The Fed says it will increase the frequency of its forecasts to four times a year from two, and extend the horizon of projections to three years from two.

February 2009 - The FOMC adds longer-run projections for GDP, unemployment and inflation to its three-year quarter forecasts. The move is seen as effectively establishing an informal inflation target.

December 2010 - As required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Fed releases the names of firms that borrowed from its special emergency programs during the financial crisis. The law did not require the release of details of past lending from its regular "discount window," although future lending will be disclosed with a two-year lag.

March 2011 - The Fed releases the names of banks that borrowed from its discount window during the financial crisis after having run out of legal appeals to block publication.

April 2011 - Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds the Fed's first-ever post-meeting news conference.

# Timeline Spain's banking crisis

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's banks are suffering a hangover from the effects of a near-decade building boom that ended in 2008 leaving lenders saddled with around 300 billion euros ($374 billion) in loans to housebuilders, equivalent to nearly one third of the country's gross domestic product.

Two recessions in three years and the highest unemployment rate amongst developed nations has compounded banks' problems, increasing the likelihood of defaults on mortgage payments and business loans.

Here are some key developments in Spain's long-running bank crisis.

March 2009 - Government takes over mid-sized savings bank CCM, which had a capital shortfall and was heavily exposed to loans to the property sector.

June 2009 - Spain aims to cut the number of unlisted regional savings banks, or cajas, originating from institutions set up hundreds of years ago to help farmers at times of poor harvest.

The state-backed bank restructuring fund, the FROB, is created,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), giving loans to help the 45 cajas merge with each other and reduce their number to around 15 to eliminate excess capacity in the banking system and make them more efficient.

May 2010 - The FROB takes control of Cajasur, a savings bank run by the Catholic Church, with troubled property loans.

February 2011 - The government demands banks get private capital on board via stock listings or equity investment to reinforce financial safety nets. Many private equity firms come to Spain in following months,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), but none end up investing.

The FROB is given extra powers and will directly inject cash into those lenders that do not manage to get private funds to raise their capital ratios up to minimum levels. As of June 2012, FROB has spent 15 billion euros to rescue banks without taking into account the biggest problem lender, Bankia.

July 2011 - FROB takes over CAM savings bank, which the head of the central bank later calls the "worst of the worst." The central bank found not only enormous losses at CAM, but the bank's directors awarded themselves multimillion euro severance pay packages that generated public rage.

July 2011 - Bankia, the result of a merger between heavyweight Caja Madrid and six smaller savings banks, lists on the Spanish stock exchange in an operation heavily dependent on retail investors and at a deeply discounted price.

Sep. 2011 - FROB takes over three savings banks -- NovaCaixaGalicia, Catalunya Caixa and Unnim -- valuing the lenders at practically zero.

November 2011 - FROB takes over Banco de Valencia.

February 2012 - The new conservative government forces banks to write off 50 billion euros of losses on repossessed property assets and loans to property developers that have fallen in arrears.

April 25 - Spain's largest banks are sufficiently capitalized to withstand a decline in economic conditions, says the International Monetary Fund, but it pinpoints a group of 10 banks, including Bankia,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), that are vulnerable.

May 2012 - The government increases provisioning demands on banks,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), asking them to write off an additional 30 billion euros on performing loans to housebuilders.

May 9 - Spain takes over Bankia by converting a 4.5 billion euro state loan into equity. As of June 8, investors in Bankia, many of them retail customers at the bank,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), had lost 70 percent of their investment.

May 23 - Spain says the rescue of Bankia will cost at least 9 billion euros.

May 25 - Bankia asks government for 19 billion euro in state rescue,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), which added to the 4.5 billion euros in convertible bonds, brings the total cost up to 23.5 billion euros.

June 1 - Bank of Spain data shows capital is flying out of Spain --mostly on the wholesale market -- due to fears on the stability of the euro zone's fourth largest economy with 66.2 billion euros of funds leaving the country in March against a surplus for the same month last year.

June 6 - Spain's public prosecutor opens an anti-corruption investigation into Bankia. ($1 = 0.8021 euros)

# Le cuivre joue en sourdine - LeMonde.fr

Depuis quatre mois, le cuivre est à la baisse. Oublié le pic des 8 800 dollars (6 782 euros), la tonne atteint le 11 mai 2006 ,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/")!

Depuis le début de l'année 2007, le métal rouge est revenu entre 5 000 et 6 000 dollars,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), au gré des grèves dans les mines chiliennes. Jouant désormais en sourdine, il a atteint à Londres, vendredi 2 février, le cours de 5 600 dollars, en chute de 40 % par rapport aux folies de 2006.

" Le déclencheur de la baisse a été le gonflement des stocks, explique Franz Wenzel, directeur adjoint de la stratégie chez AXA Investment Managers. Ceux- ci ont pratiquement doublé en 2006\. Bien qu'ils restent à un niveau historiquement bas, cette hausse confirme les analystes dans leur attente d'un ralentissement du cycle économique."

Car le cuivre est considéré par les spécialistes comme un bon baromètre de la météo industrielle mondiale. Il est le métal manufacturier par excellence qui entre dans la fabrication des tuyaux,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), des câbles, des semi-conducteurs et même des médicaments.

Or, on constate que la surproduction guette les semi-conducteurs et que le secteur de la construction, grande consommatrice de cuivre, a ralenti aux Etats-Unis comme ailleurs.

Du côté de l'offre,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), la pénurie ne menace plus. L'International Copper Study Group (ICSG) estime que la production africaine a augmenté de 16 % au cours des dix premiers mois de 2006 par rapport à la même période de 2005, grâce à la mise en exploitation de mines dans le bassin du Congo et en Zambie.

Par conséquent, l'excédent de l'offre sur la demande s'est élevé à 213 000 tonnes, contre un déficit de 298 000,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), un an plus tôt.

M. Wenzel estime que le prix du cuivre ne devrait plus baisser au même rythme et que la volatilité de son cours sera moindre que par le passé : les capitaux spéculatifs excédentaires se sont retirés de son marché à la fin de l'année 2006.

Comme l'économie chinoise ne ralentit guère, que l'américaine semble avoir surmonté ses doutes,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), que l'urbanisation mondiale appelle un regain dans la construction, qui exige câbles, tuyaux et équipements électroniques et que ce n'est pas demain la veille du jour où le cuivre sera remplacé dans sa fonction d'acheminement de l'énergie et des fluides, achetez ce métal si vous le pouvez, mais à long terme.

# Corrected Boeing 787 delivery delay hits ANA schedule

n">(Reuters) - All Nippon Airways (9202.T),[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the first operator of Boeing Co's (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner, said it will postpone the start of Dreamliner service on some international routes because of a delay in receiving another Dreamliner.

In a statement posted on its website on Thursday,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), the Japanese carrier blamed a "productivity reason" at Boeing for the delay. The airline said it would delay Dreamliner service between Tokyo and Beijing and between Tokyo and Frankfurt.

The Beijing route was scheduled to start in December,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), but has been rescheduled for January.

"ANA regrets to take the precaution of amending international flight plans. ANA will continue urgent negotiations with Boeing to deliver the 787 as early and as close to the original schedule as possible,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," the company said.

Boeing,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), through a spokeswoman, said it was working with ANA to deliver the airplane as quickly as possible but would not comment on the cause of the delay.

The 787 Dreamliner is a light-weight, carbon-composite airplane that is fuel efficient. The airplane was three years behind its development schedule but finally entered service this year.

Boeing aims to ramp up monthly production on the airplane to 10 by the end of 2013 from the current pace of 2.5\. Some experts believe the target rate is too ambitious.

Boeing has more than 800 orders for the airplane on its books.

The latest Dreamliner snag contrasts news from Boeing's top rival Airbus (EAD.PA),[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), which said on Friday it topped its 2011 target for superjumbo deliveries when it handed over two A380s in rapid succession, reaching 26 deliveries for the year.

Shares of Boeing were up 51 cents at $71.12 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon.

Peter O'Toole ne reconnaîtrait pas la plage de l'Algarrobico sur laquelle il a tourné la prise d'Akaba, séquence phare de Lawrence d'Arabie. C'est pourtant là,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), dans la province d'Almeria, au milieu d'un paysage lunaire, de collines pelées et de falaises tombant dans une mer turquoise, qu'en 1962 David Lean avait choisi de reconstituer le port de Jordanie.

Aujourd'hui, si l'Algarrobico est encore célèbre, ce n'est pas pour son passé cinématographique ni pour la beauté sauvage de sa côte. C'est pour un complexe hôtelier abandonné, monstre de béton de 21 étages et 411 chambres, creusés dans la montagne à moins de 30 mètres de la mer.

Chantier inachevé, paralysé en 2006 après trois ans de travaux, l'Algarrobico est une construction doublement illégale. Parce qu'elle se trouve dans un parc naturel protégé, celui du Cabo de Gata, l'un des derniers recoins vierges de la côte méditerranéenne espagnole. Mais aussi parce qu'elle ne respecte pas la "ley de costas" ("loi sur les côtes") de 1988, selon laquelle la frange de 100 mètres bordant la mer est du domaine public et donc non constructible.

Pourtant, en 2003, quand il commence le chantier, le promoteur dispose de toutes les autorisations en règle, en dépit d'infractions évidentes à la législation en vigueur. La municipalité lui a donné le permis de construire pour ce "mégaprojet" de tourisme "tout inclus", qui prévoyait sept hôtels et un terrain de golf... En plein désert. La région andalouse abaissera la protection de la zone, parc naturel devenu urbanisable. Quant au ministère de l'environnement,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), il ferme les yeux.

Les écologistes n'ont cessé de se battre contre l'Algarrobico, devenu le symbole de la bulle immobilière, du massacre des côtes et de l'impunité des hommes d'affaires et des politiciens. En cinq ans, 16 verdicts ont été rendus contre cette aberration urbanistique. Tous confirment qu'il est illégal. Tous appellent à sa démolition. "Qu'attendent-ils ?", demandait la banderole déployée en septembre sur l'hôtel par un groupe d'activistes de Greenpeace. "Il ne reste plus de recours possible. Cet hôtel doit être démoli", soulignait alors Pilar Marcos, responsable de la campagne côtière de l'organisation écologiste.

En réalité, il en reste encore un, déposé par le promoteur et la mairie,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), portant sur la légalité de la licence des travaux. Et bien que les autres verdicts imposent la démolition, le juge saisi du dossier s'est opposé, le 9 novembre,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), à ce qu'elle soit mise à exécution, tant que tous les recours n'ont pas été épuisés, pour ne pas causer de dommages "irréparables et irréversibles" au promoteur Azata del Sol.

Dans cette lutte pour reprendre les travaux, la mairie et le promoteur se sont trouvé des alliés de choix dans les habitants du village,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), miné par le chômage et la crise, qui ont organisé des manifestations contre les écologistes. "La nature, c'est bien beau, mais le travail c'est ce qui nous fait vivre, explique Pilar Pinillas, propriétaire du restaurant Sol y Playa de Carboneras, la commune où se trouve l'Algarrobico. Cet hôtel pourrait apporter de l'emploi aux jeunes d'ici et un peu d'activité pour les commerçants comme nous. Les écologistes disent que c'est un parc naturel, mais c'est un caprice et ce n'est pas le moment de faire des caprices."

L'écologie n'est plus guère une préoccupation dans un pays où 21 % de la population active est au chômage. Le promoteur en joue, qui a assuré que le coût de la démolition et des pertes engendrées par la fermeture des lieux se porte à 300 millions d'euros, et que la restauration du site est "techniquement" et "physiquement impossible", car pour construire l'hôtel, "65 000 mètres cubes de béton ont été incrustés dans la montagne, qui ne pourront pas être éliminés".

"L'Espagne n'a toujours pas retenu la leçon. Au lieu de mettre à profit les ressources naturelles et d'opter pour un tourisme durable qui crée de l'emploi, les gens continuent de penser que des complexes comme l'Algarrobico pourraient être la poule aux oeufs d'or", s'insurge Pilar Marcos.

L'Espagne, descendue avec la crise de 2e à 4e puissance touristique mondiale, doit se réinventer, le secteur en convient. "Il a été prouvé que le modèle "tout inclus" n'est pas rentable, souligne Antonio Lopez de Avila, directeur du master en tourism management de l'IE Business School de Madrid. Les hôteliers espagnols se sont rendu compte qu'ils doivent augmenter les prix et pour cela la qualité. Le touriste du XXIe siècle est très différent de celui des années 1970\. Et l'Espagne doit aujourd'hui se battre contre les marchés turc, égyptien, tunisien et marocain,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), moins chers."

Pour cela, elle doit offrir autre chose que des complexes de béton qui défigurent la côte, comme l'Algarrobico.

# Morgan Stanley banker pleads not guilty in cab driver assaul

STAMFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - A senior Morgan Stanley banker pleaded not guilty on Friday to hate crime, theft and assault charges stemming from an incident last December that police say escalated from a dispute over a $200-plus cab fare to a knife attack on the driver.

William Bryan Jennings, who had been co-head of North American fixed-income capital markets at the Wall Street bank until being put on leave following his arrest last month, entered "not guilty" pleas to each of three charges against him.

Jennings, wearing a blue blazer, white shirt and royal blue tie, entered the pleas in Stamford Superior Court. He now faces an April 12 trial date for charges of assault, larceny and "intimidation by bigotry or bias."

If found guilty on all counts, the charges collectively carry a maximum penalty of 11 years in jail and a fine of up to $11,000.

Jennings, a Ferrari-driving banker from Darien, a wealthy town on Connecticut's Long Island Sound shoreline, arrived at court in a black Toyota Tacoma pickup truck with his lawyer. No other family or friends were in attendance at the brief arraignment hearing, although more than a dozen reporters, photographers and videographers attended.

He remains free on a $9,500 cash bond, initially set after his arrest in Darien on February 29.

The charges stem from a late-night cab ride last December of about 45 miles Jennings took from Manhattan to his $2.3 million home at 39 Knollwood Lane.

Upon reaching the destination, the driver, Mohamed Helmy Ammar,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), and Jennings, who the driver said was intoxicated, argued about the fare. According to police,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), the two had agreed upon a fare of $204 at the outset of the ride, but when the driver requested payment, Jennings refused.

Jennings lawyer Eugene Riccio has disputed that version of events, saying the driver assessed a charge of nearly $300,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), which Jennings considered excessive.

With Jennings still in the car,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), the driver began driving around the city looking for a police officer to resolve the dispute, according to police. Riccio also contests that, saying the driver was not looking for police, but "speeding down the road, door open,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), disregarding traffic signals" and threatening to bring Jennings back to Manhattan unless he paid the fare.

Ammar, who lives in Queens, New York, and is an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen, told police that Jennings began threatening him and using racial slurs.

The banker then took out a pen knife and began stabbing at the driver through an open partition, police said. When the driver tried to close the partition, Jennings stabbed his hand.

The driver received immediate medical attention in Darien and later went to a hospital where the lacerations required six stitches,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), according to Darien police.

# American Airlines, pilots reach tentative contract

n">(Reuters) - Pilot union leaders at American Airlines reached a tentative agreement with management on Wednesday on a steep cost-cutting contract aimed at heading off a threat by the carrier to abandon the current deal in bankruptcy and impose stricter terms.

The Allied Pilots Association board voted 9 to 7 to send the last and best offer to its membership for consideration, the union and the company said.

A vote by members is expected in coming weeks, prompting the judge overseeing American's case in New York to postpone a ruling that had been scheduled for Friday on whether to allow the airline to abrogate the pilots' contract, the airline said.

Ratification by pilots would end years of bitter negotiations and introduce a measure of labor stability to American's bankruptcy.

The airline is seeking more than $1.2 billion in cost cuts from its unions annually, a key factor in its decision to seek Chapter 11 protection from creditors last November.

Added certainty from labor would allow the parties to shift focus to American's planned emergence later this year and whether it will do so alone or as part of a merger.

The six-year deal was revisited over the past several days after union board members rejected a previous proposal from American's parent, AMR Corp (AAMRQ.PK).

Details of the tentative deal were not released. But proposed terms disclosed over the past few days included $315 million in annual cost savings - down from $370 million - no layoffs,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), annual pay raises, and a stake in the new company.

The union representing 10,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"),000 pilots had no immediate comment beyond confirming the deal and the board's vote.

American said it believed pilots would carefully consider the proposal,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), which would be a watershed in the company's restructuring if it is approved.

"We believe this agreement addresses the needs of our pilots while achieving the goals of our business plan, and further demonstrates our commitment to reaching consensual agreements with all of our unions," American said in a statement.

A final agreement by pilots, the most powerful work group,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), is likely to clear the way for American's flight attendants and mechanics also to reach new contracts. The airline said it would meet with those unions next week.

AMR is under pressure from unions to tie up with US Airways (LCC.N). American has said it would explore consolidation but prefers to exit bankruptcy as a standalone company.

US Airways struck a merger deal with America West in 2005 while still in bankruptcy,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), but the deal was necessary for its immediate survival.

American's case appears more along the lines of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and Northwest. The two emerged from their bankruptcies with similar cost structures and then formed a partnership.

American's motion in bankruptcy court to vacate contracts follows a similar pattern by other U.S. airlines that took the bankruptcy route.

Even in cases where carriers won court permission to throw out collective bargaining agreements, they wound up reaching consensual deals with those unions before exiting bankruptcy.

The case is In re AMR Corp et al,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-15463

# Euro zone finmins to discuss outcome of Greek vote on Sunday

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers are scheduled to hold a teleconference on Sunday evening to discuss the outcome of Greek elections, two euro zone officials said on Thursday.

Greece holds a parliamentary election on Sunday and polls show that the leftist SYRIZA party, that rejects the terms of the euro zone bailout for Athens, is neck-and-neck with the pro-bailout New Democracy party.

If STRIZA won the election and Greece were to tear up the terms of the bailout, France and other euro zone countries have warned that Greece could face leaving the euro zone and returning to the drachma currency.

One euro zone official said that the main concern,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), if SYRIZA overwhelmingly won the election, was the risk of large capital outflows from Greece if depositors worry their savings in euros could later be frozen or converted into drachmas.

"It is not even about a bank run on Monday morning after the elections. People can now log on to internet banking and make transfers on Sunday evening as well,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/")," a third euro zone official said, explaining the rationale of the ministerial call.

If a SYRIZA victory sparked panic about a return of the drachma,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the immediate action would come from the country's central bank,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), backed by the European Central Bank.

The Greek central bank has the ability to directly inject cash into the country's banks, if savers rush for their money,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), in the form of Emergency Liquidity Assistance,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), which although provided by the ECB, would be underwritten solely by Greece.

Top ECB officials and staff would also keep a close watch from Frankfurt and keep in touch with other euro zone central banks, in case there were signs that people in other countries such as Spain were starting to pull their cash from banks.

Among the euro zone contingency plans for a possible Greek exit from the euro are the suspension of the Schengen passport-free zone and imposing capital controls and limiting ATM withdrawals.

- A new Notification Center will display pop-up banner notifications for events, reminders,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), messages and more. A mute switch will allow users to turn off all notifications.

# Newmont may shift spending from costly Peru mine

(Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) will put its money into projects in other countries if environmental changes to its proposed $4.8 billion Conga gold mine in Peru prove economically unfeasible,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), the head of the U.S. company said on Friday.</p> <p>"We have other options if it is not favorable," Chief Executive Officer

# Analysis Beauty industry sees growth at its fingertips

<p>PARIS (Reuters) - Nail varnish has become the top-selling fashion accessory, replacing lipstick as an affordable indulgence in austere times and leading to a boom in sales as consumers flock to buy bright-colored bottles.</p> <p>Industry insiders predict nail color will be the fastest-growing beauty business in the next few years, providing a small yet promising pocket of growth for beauty groups such as Coty and L'Oreal who have led the rush to snap up independent brands.</p><p>In France, over the whole of 2010,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), perfume sales in department stores rose 2 percent. Over the same period nail color jumped 42 percent,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), according to global market research company NPD.</p><p>"We used to measure the economy with the lipstick index - when times got tough, we bought a lipstick. Now the economic barometer is measured by nail polish: as times get difficult, you buy a nail polish,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," said Suzi Weiss-Fischmann, co-founder and artistic director of OPI, a U.S. nail polish company acquired last year by perfume maker Coty COTY.UL.</p><p>"It is a small thing that makes you feel good and brings you instant gratification."</p><p>Nail polish is still a small sub-sector of the global beauty industry compared to other make-up items such as lipstick, and looks even smaller when compared to perfume, but it is on its way to becoming an important business, analysts say.</p><p>"We are seeing an explosion in many countries," said Karen Grant, senior global analyst and vice-president of NPD's beauty division, mentioning the United States, France and Britain as examples.</p><p>She likened the trajectory of nail varnish sales to that of lip gloss, a niche business which saw sales grow tenfold over the past decade. "If the nail polish market continues to grow, it could also become a big category," Grant said.</p><p>In the U.S., nail polish sales from department stores and mass market retailers excluding Walmart, rose 22 percent to $337 million in the six months to June 30, she said. Over the whole of 2010, sales rose 15 percent to $530 million.</p><p>In Europe, the total mass market value of the nail polish market grew twice as fast as the overall make-up market, jumping 29 percent between 2007 and 2010 while the broader make-up market rose 17 percent, based on figures from Nielsen and IRI research cited by L'Oreal.</p><p>Nail bars, which have mushroomed in big U.S. cities, have become increasingly prevalent on Europe's high streets in recent years, targeting women seeking a small morale- boost at a small price.</p><p>ZANY NAMES</p><p>Some of the most coveted shades go by zany names.

# Analysis Big business scores key Supreme Court term wins

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Giant retailer Wal-Mart Inc, telecommunications company AT&T Inc and coal power companies came out the big winners in the U.S. Supreme Court's just-ended term that rejected large lawsuits against them.</p> <p>The high court threw out the largest sex-discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history by Wal-Mart's female employees, ruled for AT&T in favoring arbitration over big class actions and ended a global warming lawsuit against the utilities.</p><p>Despite some losses, businesses prevailed in the biggest cases, provoking criticism by liberal groups that the court's five-member conservative majority shielded companies from suits seeking to protect workers, consumers or the environment.</p><p>"It is a pro-business court," said Steven Shapiro,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, in assessing the 2010-11 term that ended on Monday.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the instinct to protect business interests often comes at the expense of ordinary citizens looking for justice," he said.</p><p>Other rulings held a mutual fund's investment adviser cannot be sued for securities fraud over misstatements in fund prospectuses and gave greater protection to generic drug companies and vaccine makers from liability lawsuits.</p><p>On the term's last day, the court struck down a California law banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors for violating free-speech rights, a landmark victory for video game publishers, distributors and sellers.</p><p>Leland Yee,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), a California state senator who authored the law,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), said, "The Supreme Court once again put the interests of corporate America before the interests of our children."</p><p>NOT BEST OR WORST TERM FOR BUSINESS GROUP</p><p>Robin Conrad,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), head of the legal arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, rejected the notion of a pro-business court and said its term had produced mixed results.</p><p>"It goes without saying that this was not our best Supreme Court term.

<p>n">(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn revealed he had bought a 7.6 percent stake in Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) and called for the natural gas producer to replace at least four directors, saying the board has failed "in a dramatic fashion" in its oversight of management.</p> <p>The corporate-raider-turned-activist investor asked the company for two board seats for his own representatives and two for another large shareholder such as Chesapeake's largest, Southeastern Asset Management.</p><p>The news was the latest in a saga that has seen the company come under intense pressure from investors to improve its corporate governance after Reuters reported in April that Chesapeake Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon had taken out more than $1 billion in loans using his personal stakes in thousands of company wells as collateral.</p><p>Icahn's move had been widely rumored, and McClendon told analysts earlier this month he would not be surprised if Icahn bought in, since he had made hundreds of millions of dollars in the stock last year.</p><p>But Icahn blasted the company in a letter to Chesapeake's board of directors, saying its earlier promises to act in a more financially responsible way had proven hollow.</p><p>"This board has led the company through a highly publicized spate of corporate governance breakdowns while amassing an astounding $16 billion funding gap, which we believe has contributed to the share price decline of over 55 percent from the 52-week high,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," Icahn wrote in a letter to the company.</p><p>Icahn holds 50.1 million shares in the company,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), according to a regulatory filing.

# So, you want to be an online entrepreneur, huh

<p> I spend countless hours counseling and mentoring people who are attempting to start businesses, who are either trying to use the internet as a primary marketing tool, or who are trying to run completely online businesses. Many of my mentees are frustrated. They were either lured into their businesses by some slick advertising, or started their businesses thinking that an internet business would be a simple thing to make money with.

The exasperation many of the people I work with feel is completely understandable. My job is to explain to them the realities of an "internet" business. My purpose in writing this article is to help some of you, who are in the same or a similar situation, to understand the realities of internet business, and to encourage you that there is a paycheck, if not a pot of gold, at the end of the internet rainbow.

So, here are a couple of principles regarding starting and running an internet business.

1\. Don't believe the people who say it's easy!

Running an internet business, running a multi-level marketing business, or running a brick and mortar business all have something in common: It takes work, skill and knowledge to be successful. You never, never,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), never get something for nothing. And running a successful business requires hard work and dedication. One of the reasons that "brick and mortar" business are successful is that the owners have a huge financial commitment upfront. Much of the time, because it doesn't cost a great deal of money to start an internet business or an MLM business, the level of commitment required to succeed just isn't there. You have to treat your MLM business or your internet business just the same as though you had mortgaged your house to start your business.

2\. Running a Successful Internet Business Requires knowledge and skill

Twitter, Facebook, Articles,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/"), Blogs,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), Craigs List ... the list is almost endless. And because social networking is so new, the rules, and the way to be successful change almost daily. In order to find success on the internet, you must be dedicated to learning as much as possible. Subscribe to blogs. With a little digging, you can find thousands of free sites and free blogs you can subscribe to to learn what,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/")!) available to you to learn. It's easy to get sucked into buying people's "programs" for success,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), when, in truth, there's a lot of great, free information availabe if you want to learn. But you absolutely must learn!

3\. Work Hard

It sounds cliche,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), but the truth is that you can't be successful if you're not willing to put in the time and effort required to be successful. Anyone who tells you that all you need to do is put up a website and deposit your checks, is dead wrong. It doesn't matter whether you are opening a running store on main street or an internet business, you have got to put in the hours required to be successful.

# Draghi skips Jackson Hole ahead of pivotal ECB meeting

<p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will not attend the annual Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers at the end of this week due to a heavy workload, the ECB said on Tuesday as its policymakers gear up for a critical meeting on September 6.</p> <p>Draghi had been expected to speak at the Jackson Hole gathering,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), but the retreat in the U.S. state of Wyoming falls just as ECB policymakers are hammering out the details of a new bond-buying plan aimed at tackling the euro zone debt crisis.</p><p>ECB policymaker Joerg Asmussen stressed on Monday that the bank's policymakers were still working on operational and technical details of the plan,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), which is aimed at easing the crippling borrowing costs facing Spain and Italy.</p><p>When asked whether Draghi was no longer planning to attend the Jackson Hole meeting,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), an ECB spokesman said: "That's correct ...

# Analysis Self-regulation the way forward for oil

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - While governments and regulators dither, IntercontinentalExchange energy hub has moved ahead of the curve, with steps to boost transparency that could increase the lure of its flagship Brent contract over its U.S. rival.</p> <p>Every Monday,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/"), ICE Futures Europe (ICE.N) will publish a breakdown of what kind of traders are active on its Brent and gasoil contracts, widely viewed as its most useful, global pricing benchmarks.</p><p>The measure is imposed by the exchange, not the regulator, but narrows the regulatory gap between the ICE Brent contract and the world's most liquid futures contract U.S. futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).</p><p>"The move was long due and it is smart of the ICE to do it on a voluntary basis," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, who has published forensic analysis of the U.S. regulator's data and will now scrutinize the ICE figures.</p><p>"The ICE wants Brent to be the global crude oil benchmark and that would have been difficult without some added transparency."</p><p>For decades, the U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has produced a weekly breakdown of market participants for the range of commodities futures.</p><p>The division was previously into commercial and non-commercial, loosely considered resource-holding companies and speculators respectively.</p><p>Beginning in 2009 and phased in across different commodities, the categories have been redefined as producers, swap dealers, money managers and other reportables. The ICE has opted to use the same more granular divisions.</p><p>Until this week's announcement, some traders had argued the lack of transparency on ICE relative to NYMEX could be an incentive to trade there for maker players seeking anonymity.</p><p>In the event,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), analysts and traders said transparency was a good thing, as was self-regulation.</p><p>"It's better to have a trading environment self-regulated rather than having the government tell you what to do," said one trader at an investment bank who asked to remain anonymous.</p><p>One of the pioneers of the move into commodities as an asset class, who asked not to be named, said ultimately fundamentals of supply and demand still mattered most of all.</p><p>"The larger factor causing any investors to move their crude positions from WTI to Brent is their belief in the underlying fundamental economics of the two markets," he said.</p><p>BRENT STRENGTH</p><p>Since late last year, Brent has enjoyed unusual strength relative to the U.S. futures contract and its premium to U.S. futures on NYMEX reached a record of more than $23 a barrel earlier this month.</p><p>Volumes of trade on ICE's Brent still lags its U.S. equivalent U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but in terms of percentage growth has outperformed.</p><p>Gasoil has been particularly strong and in May around 4.9 million futures contracts traded,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), compared with around 2.6 million for heating oil.</p><p>For many kinds of player, including long-term investors, such as pension funds as well as those seeking shorter term exposure, increased transparency is one more reason to buy and sell Brent rather than landlocked U.S. crude.</p><p>"I think the two will flip in share. WTI will have the share that Brent had five years ago and vice versa," said a hedge fund trader based in New York who asked not to be named.</p><p>"My view is that the oil market players have gotten more broad and as such have realized that a waterborne marker is a much better indicator than a land-locked one."</p><p>Jakob said the breakdown could allay suspicion Brent's strength relative to U.S. crude meant Brent as well as U.S. futures had lost its connection to underlying physical reality and was distorted by trading plays.</p><p>"It should stop the baseless speculation about price making manipulation in Brent," he said.</p><p>The price impact is hard to quantify. But if traders knew speculators were net long, that might limit their appetite to also buy, which could prevent price trends being exaggerated.</p><p>"If you see speculators are looking long,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), it might put you off going long yourself. You might think it's looking over-bought," said Tony Machacek of Bache Commodities.</p><p>The effect of speculative and investment- class money, as opposed to buying and selling by producers and major consumers has been the subject of lengthy debate, but no-one has ever proved whether it inflates oil and other commodity markets.</p><p>Regulators and governments, increasingly desperate to rein in rising commodity prices,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), are pressing for reforms, but so far they have been mired in the process.</p><p>The head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it would not introduce long-awaited position limit plans for commodities soon. [ID:nN1599324]</p><p>Britain's Financial Services Authority, which regulates ICE's Brent and gasoil contracts,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), is regarded as light-touch.</p><p>The president of ICE Europe said it worked in close collaboration with the regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>"The exchange continues to have a very important role in regulating the markets, but we work very closely with the regulators including the FSA in the UK and the CFTC in the U.S. We share information on a daily basis," David Peniket told Reuters in an interview.</p> Related Quotes and News Company Price Related NewsRelated Theme Articles:

# Exclusive Merrill MVPs earn half firm's revenue, big payche

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The multimillion-dollar signing bonuses that big brokerages are doling out to recruit elite brokers may seem excessive, but internal reports from Merrill Lynch show why firms are willing to pay top dollar for a top broker.</p> <p>Nearly 46 percent of the revenue received by Merrill Lynch's Global Wealth Management unit last year came from just 21 percent of its top-producing brokers, about 2,500 people, according to copies of the reports reviewed by Reuters.</p><p>The monthly reports, available internally as a performance scorecard, provide a rare look inside Merrill, revealing just how far ahead the top one-fifth of advisers are from the rest of the pack.</p><p>The reports do not detail each adviser's revenue contribution,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), but they help provide the best estimate of Merrill's top performers. The reports divide brokers into smaller groups and provide average revenue and compensation credit figures,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), which Reuters used to calculate take-home pay and estimated revenue for each group of brokers.</p><p>Last year, the top 2,400 brokers generated an average of $2.5 million each in revenue for Merrill, double the average of advisers in the next 20 percent,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), who brought in $1.2 million each on average, according to a report that covered the full year.</p><p>The revenue figures, which include money the firm receives from products that brokers sell and any additional money earned from managing client assets,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), underscore why Wall Street brokerages are in an arms race for talent: Elite performers account for an outsized portion of revenue.</p><p>"Clearly the top 20 percent of brokers are far and away the best of the best," said Michael Kostoff, managing partner with the wealth management consultancy The Kostoff Group based in Washington. "These are the guys everyone wants."</p><p>Some firms, like UBS,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), have paid bonuses of up to double those paid by rivals for elite brokers. UBS has hired at least 28 top brokers away from Merrill so far this year, according to Reuters data. And most brokerages are offering far more in sign-on bonuses than they have in years past.</p><p>Merrill declined to comment for this story.</p><p>Revenue at Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, the brokerage business, totaled $13.5 billion last year, ahead of its closest rival, Morgan Stanley, which reported revenue of $13.4 billion for its global wealth management group.</p><p>The internal Merrill reports also show that not all brokers in the firm's famous "Thundering Herd" are bringing money into the firm. The number of revenue-producing brokers at the end of 2011 was 12,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"),107, compared with the firm's public total broker headcount - excluding the consumer banking division - of 16,165.</p><p>Trainees likely make up most of the difference, industry experts said. Internal figures obtained by Reuters show a similar gap at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney - the firm had 13,745 revenue-producing brokers as of March. It reported having 17,193 advisers in its first quarter earnings.</p><p>The Merrill reports also show:</p><p> _About 4,500 advisers brought in an average of $1 million or more in revenue for the firm. Of those, about 1,450 brokers with 10 or more years of experience brought in more than $2 million.</p><p>_ The average revenue brought in by all revenue-producing brokers was nearly $1.1 million.</p><p> _Top brokers likely got paid an average of nearly $1 million last year, about 22 times more than the lowest performers, according to Reuters calculations.</p><p>_ Just 12 percent of advisers - those in the top one-fifth of all brokers by revenue generation - with 10 or more years of experience accounted for an estimated 32 percent of the wealth business's annual revenue.</p><p>Broker production, a figure that counts revenue that earns a broker a commission or fee, is listed on a separate report that advisers often use to keep score of where they are against the pack. Generally in the industry, every $1 million in production translates into about $100 million in client assets under management.</p><p>Merrill has about $1.8 trillion in managed assets, brokerage assets, deposits and loans.</p><p>Poaching an elite broker is one of the only quick ways to bring more revenue to a firm. It can take a decade for a new adviser to build $100 million in client money.</p><p>So firms are paying more and more to attract top producers. The best candidates can get up to $5 million in bonuses by taking an offer from another firm and staying for the full length of their contract of about nine years, said Courtney Raymond, a recruiter for Merrill and founder of Houston-based Courtney Raymond Consultants.</p><p>The size of bonuses have become "astronomical," she said.

# Instant View Consumer spending rises 0.7 percent

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in February for the eighth straight month of gains as households tapped their savings,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), government data showed on Monday, while inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since June 2009.</p> <p>KEY POINTS: _The Commerce Department said spending rose 0.7 percent after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in January._ Economists polled by Reuters had expected spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), to advance 0.6 percent in February after a previously reported 0.2 percent rise.</p><p>COMMENTS:</p><p>JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY:</p><p>"The PCE numbers will help both sides of the QE dispute. Inflation is hig
her but not by enough to worry Bernanke."</p><p>PAUL DALES, SENIOR US ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, TORONTO:</p><p>"February's U.S. personal and income spending data provide yet more evidence that higher prices are denting economic growth. The 0.3 percent m/m increase in nominal income was not too bad - incomes were up by 5.1 percent in the last year.</p><p>"But as prices are rising at a faster rate, real incomes fell, by 0.1 percent m/m. That's the first drop since September.</p><p>"Similarly, higher prices, especially for gasoline,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), meant that the decent 0.7 percent m/m gain in nominal spending translated into a modest 0.3 percent m/m increase in real spending. That's better than in either of the previous two months,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), but it's still not much to shout about.</p><p>"Even if real spending were to increase by 0.3 percent m/m in March, real consumption in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of between 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent. That would suggest the 4.1 percent gain seen in the fourth quarter of last year was just another false dawn."</p><p>MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BNY MELLON GLOBAL MARKETS, NEW YORK:</p><p>"Judging from the CPI, PPI and PCE data, core inflation has bottomed and begun to rise, albeit at a glacial pace. From Bernanke's perspective, today's data reaffirms the need to maintain the current QE II program until inflation and unemployment return to more desirable levels. At the same time, the personal savings rate remains comfortably above the 5.0 percent level, despite signs that the consumer spending is picking up. Without explicit evidence of inflationary problems in the core, it is difficult to imagine Bernanke's dovish position being altered in any material way. Plosser's comments on Friday not withstanding, it is premature to expect any sustained campaign of monetary tightening from the Fed."</p><p>WAYNE KAUFMAN,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK:</p><p>"All these numbers look reasonably in line, so there's no surprise. You're seeing really a nil reaction in futures."</p><p>DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT:</p><p>"The headlines were close to consensus expectations but some of the underlying components are a bit tedious. Real PCE and income gains were tame to say the least versus their nominal components showing that higher prices are behind most of the gains versus a real increase in spending.</p><p>"So, higher prices represent a tax in the sense incomes are not holding pace. Real income ex transfer were 0 percent. Thus Q1 GDP looks weaker than the consensus forecasts at this stage.</p><p>"The bond market, of course, is weaker as it faces supply and the curve is pretty steady through it all. Is it a focus on inflation implied in this report? We're not sure but suspect supply is its own 'reward.'"</p><p>FRANK LESH, A FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), CHICAGO:</p><p>"The consumption number was good and that is supportive for the market. There was some thought that consumer spending might not be holding up in the current environment and this says those worries may be unfounded -- at least for the time being."</p><p>MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold slight gains.

# 3 Tips To Find The Best SEO Tutorial Online

<p> If you're in internet business, you know how competitive it is. It's essential to get an edge over competitors to get some extra traffic and more conversions. The easiest way to get ahead of your competitors is to do some SEO tutorials and find out some sneaky tricks no one else knows.

SEO, short for search engine optimization,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), is a great start to drive traffic to your website. It's a traffic strategy that allows you to rank highly in the search engines,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), thereby capturing what is called organic traffic (meaning traffic that is nor paid for per click or visitor). This has become a necessity for any web based business simply because it is the best way to reach the most people with the least expense. SEO is generally regarded as being a 'free' traffic generation strategy,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), as it doesn't have the same cost as pay-per-click advertising (for example).

But website optimization requires a lot of time and expertise to learn the skills, apply them and wait for the results. Results can take 3 to 6 months to kick in, depending on the competition for your chosen keywords. Alternatively, you can of course choose to outsource your search engine optimization to a specialist, which can cost from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the provider you choose.

If you choose to learn how to do search engine optimization yourself, you're well advised to check out some SEO tutorials. SEO can be confusing when you first start. To avoid information overload, you want to find an easy-to- understand tutorial to get you started.

When choosing a search engine optimization tutorial, you want to look for the following three things:

1\. Provides a basic Overview - In the beginning it's best to focus on the basic, but important aspects of SEO, rather than getting involved in the technical details. Instead find a tutorial that will give you a basic overview of the most effective techniques. 20 percent of your effort will give you 80 percent of your results.

2\. Easy to Read - As a beginner it's much easier to understand a tutorial that's easy to read and doesn't use much jargon.

3\. Links to additional resources - Once you've learnt about the basics of website optimization, you might be interested in going deeper on some of the topics. In that instance, having additional resources and links really pays off.

While having the best value offer is important, you also need to get visitors to your website so the word about your offer can spread. Like any website, business or sale,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), the old adage of 'Build it and they will come' does not apply. So learning the basics of search engine optimization through SEO tutorials is a great first step to beating your competitors.

------------------------------

Out of all the SEO tutorials I have looked at,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), this SEO ebook is my favourite. It discusses the vital topics of SEO,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), such as keyword research, on-page optimization and link building, yet it's easy to understand with a navigation menu and search function.

# Analysis IMF funds drive caught in global power shift

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tensions among some of the world's leading economies are on a boil over a plan to raise new resources for the International Monetary Fund to contain the euro zone debt crisis and a quest by emerging economies to win more say in the global lender.</p> <p>World finance leaders gathering in Washington next week will focus on proposals for countries to contribute more money to the IMF so it is better prepared in case of a fallout from any further escalation of Europe's debt crises.</p><p>Emerging market countries like China, Brazil and Russia are willing to put up more money for the IMF but they want something in return: greater voting power in the global lender.</p><p>It has become a hot-button issue given negotiations formally began this week on the next phase of IMF voting reforms to be completed in 2013\. The emerging market push likely means Europe's voting share will be further diluted.</p><p>In January,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the IMF said it would need $600 billion in new resources to help "innocent bystanders" who might be affected by economic and financial spillovers from Europe's travails.</p><p>Earlier this week, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said the lender may not need as much money as it had thought because economic risks had waned. On Friday officials from the Group of 20 nations told Reuters the world's major economies are likely to agree to provide the IMF somewhere between $400 billion and $500 billion.</p><p>A G20 official, who requested anonymity, said the fundraising effort would likely raise about $50 billion from Japan and a similar amount from China and Saudi Arabia,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), in addition to the $200 billion already committed by Europe. Smaller amounts will likely come from countries such as Russia, Mexico and Brazil.</p><p>BUDGET POLITICS</p><p>IMF funding will be discussed by the Group of Seven wealthy nations on April 19, jointly by the G20 and G7 that evening,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), and at a lunch the following day among the G20 and the Fund's steering committee, G20 sources said.</p><p>Lagarde said she hoped to make progress on the issue at next week's meetings but said an agreement could take time.</p><p>G20 sources said Beijing was being cautious given internal opposition against providing money for wealthy Europeans, even though the funds are meant to protect non-European nations.</p><p>Together with other emerging economies like Brazil and India, Beijing wants any funding commitment eventually tied to greater IMF voting power.</p><p>The United States, which is heading into a presidential election in which its hefty budget deficits are a key topic, has insisted it will not be part of the fundraising effort for the IMF. Canada is also unlikely to give money.</p><p>U.S. officials say they are already helping Europe by providing dollar swap lines to the European Central Bank to ease dollar funding strains among European institutions.</p><p>Some senior IMF officials say not having Washington participate has changed the dynamic of the fundraising effort since the United States is the largest IMF shareholder and its leadership is often sought on such issues.</p><p>IMF sources said an agreement on new IMF resources would likely be postponed until a G20 leaders' summit in June.</p><p>"The Americans have to be part of this, perhaps not quite as much as they would've been in the past, but through some significant gesture," said Uri Dadush, director of the International Economics Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "They have to be part of the leadership group that makes it happen."</p><p>GROWING FRUSTRATIONS</p><p>The growing frustration among emerging economies with the slow pace of IMF governance reforms has been exacerbated by a likely delay of a 2010 agreement on voting reforms, which the United States pushed for aggressively.</p><p>The reforms included changes in the make-up of the IMF's 24-member board, in which two chairs occupied by European countries would go to emerging economies.</p><p>However, the package cannot go through until the U.S. Congress approves the move,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), which is highly unlikely ahead of November elections because it would require authorizing additional funding for the IMF.</p><p>The 2010 reforms would move China into third place in the ranks of IMF voters, while also increasing the voting share of Brazil and India.</p><p>Paulo Nogueira Batista, the IMF executive director for Brazil and a constituency of other Latin American and Caribbean countries, said the United States needed to stick by its 2010 commitment.</p><p>"There is a commitment in the agreement to undertake best efforts to complete the steps by the annual meetings this year (in October), and that commitment includes the U.S.," said Nogueira Batista, speaking in his personal capacity. "I expect them to follow through with the commitment."</p><p>"The problem is that the economic and political difficulties of the advanced economies, mainly the U.S. and euro area, are having negative spillover effects on international governance," he said, "They are negatively affecting the G20 and the functioning of the IMF through delays in the implementation of the agreed reforms."</p><p>While there are frustrations with U.S. delays, many countries understand the tough political environment the Obama administration faces.</p><p>The new negotiations under way on voting reforms will initially focus on agreement around a formula for calculating quotas, or membership subscriptions. The new formula will influence how members' voting shares are realigned to give emerging and developing countries more say.</p><p>Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said emerging economies are using the IMF's push for more resources as leverage to gain even more voting power in the next round of reforms.</p><p>"This is a very political game," said Lombardi,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/"), a former World Bank board director "What emerging economies are saying is that even if the 2010 reform package is not approved at least you have to be more lenient and concede more on the quota formula discussion."</p><p>"They are in a position to exert the greatest bargaining power they can and extract concessions from the advanced economies,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/")," he said.</p><p>(Editing by Andrea Ricci)</p> World Euro Zone IMFRelated Theme Articles:

# UnitedHealth to join Dow as only healthcare insurer

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) will replace Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.O) in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, putting the nation's largest health insurer in the storied 30-stock index at a time when an aging U.S. population is making healthcare one of the strongest-growing segments of the economy.</p> <p>UnitedHealth joins pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) among the Dow's healthcare stocks. Insurance is already represented by Travelers Companies Inc (TRV.N), though UnitedHealth will be the only insurance stock with a healthcare focus.</p><p>"We believe it is an industry that needs to be represented in the Dow," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York. On a conference call, Blitzer said the absence of a healthcare insurance stock was "something of an issue" for the committee.</p><p>The group has been volatile in recent years because of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, and because of aging U.S. population demographics, which could increase demand for long-term healthcare options.</p><p>"To me, it just shows the sector is gaining the kind of importance and visibility with the Street that it should be getting," said Ana Gupte,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York. "I think it's pretty clear that private-public partnerships are the future."</p><p>The move is effective at the close of markets on September 21, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday.</p><p>EXCLUSIVE CLUB</p><p>The Dow industrials have been in existence since 1896, devised as a way to keep track of overall trends in the market. These days, the broader S&P 500 Index .INX .SPX is considered a more accurate barometer of the market.</p><p>Still,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), the Dow's limited membership of 30 stocks and the infrequent changes in the average make its composition a popular topic among market enthusiasts.</p><p>UnitedHealth's market cap of more than $55 billion is well below other companies that are seen as popular choices to become Dow components, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the most valuable U.S. company, and Google Inc (GOOG.O).</p><p>"Google and Apple are very popular stocks, but given the way the Dow is calculated as a price-weighted index, they could potentially distort the Dow and I don't think we would be doing a service by adding them," said Blitzer, referring to how the price of each component in the blue-chip average determines its weighting, with the most expensive shares having more influence.</p><p>Both Apple and Google have share prices above $600\. International Business Machines (IBM.N), the fourth-biggest stock in the Dow by market cap, has a weighting of 11.8 percent in the index due to its $200-plus share price, however that will drop to 11.71 percent after the changes.</p><p>UnitedHealth will have a weighting of 3.06 percent when it is added, according to Birinyi Associates.</p><p>Shares of UnitedHealth were up 0.1 percent at $53.93 on Friday afternoon,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), are up 7.9 percent so far this year. Kraft shares were down 0.5 percent at $39.93.</p><p>The removal of Kraft follows the company's plan to split itself into a snack company called Mondelez International and a North American grocery business with the Kraft name.</p><p>Noting that Mondelez will be significantly smaller than Kraft and that the majority of Mondelez's revenue will come from outside the United States,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Blitzer said that "if a stock is clearly not eligible to be added, we'll consider removing it,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), especially if we see a better or more interesting stock that's eligible to go in."</p><p>Kraft's tenure in the Dow was a short one, as it had been there only since September 2008, when it replaced American International Group Inc (AIG.N) amid the financial crisis. Food stocks will still be represented in the Dow by Coca- Cola Co (KO.N) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).</p><p>(Additional reporting by Anna Yukhananov in Washington; editing by Leslie Adler,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), John Wallace, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Matthew Lewis)</p> Related Quotes and News Company Price Related NewsRelated Theme Articles:

# Q+A How does the budget proposal work

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday submits to Congress his third annual budget plan, one for the fiscal year 2012 that begins on October 1.</p> <p>Given the shape of the nation's finances -- successive years of record budget deficits that have piled onto a federal debt that many economists deem unmanageable -- this budget proposal is particularly important to politicians and financial markets.</p><p>But what exactly is in budgets produced by presidents and how key are they in determining fiscal policy?</p><p>WHAT IS THE BUDGET?</p><p>It's a political document that gives the president another forum for unveiling new policy initiatives, but it is not a single bill that is put up for a vote. While it's full of numbers, the budget is an opportunity for presidents to show where they want to take the country over the next few years and how they will pay the bill.</p><p>In a budget message introducing last year's proposal, Obama spoke of the need to improve healthcare and the environment, which were hot topics all year.</p><p>WHAT TO WATCH FOR?</p><p>This year, people will watch whether Obama calls for major changes to Social Security,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), Medicare and Medicaid and whether he goes beyond his State of the Union call for $400 billion in savings by freezing many federal programs for five years.</p><p>Another question is whether Obama will formally embrace some recommendations that his deficit commission submitted last year to cut spending and raise taxes.</p><p>In hard times, presidents can use the budget to try to pep up a dispirited country.</p><p>Last year's budget message concluded: "These have been tough times and there will be difficult months ahead. But the storms of the past are receding; the skies are brightening; and the horizon is beckoning once more." Fostering optimism is one way presidents get re- elected.</p><p>WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET?</p><p>Beyond the rhetoric in the opening message,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), the thick volumes that make up the document are filled with economic projections that analysts and financial markets pore over.</p><p>The Obama administration's latest forecasts of annual budget deficits, economic growth, inflation, debt and interest rates are embedded, although sometimes these figures can be sugar- coated to put the administration in the best possible light. Or, projections might be made to look even worse than expected, making it easier for the administration to later boast about fantastic progress.</p><p>The budget also can contain programs that the president says he wants to terminate immediately.</p><p>WHAT HAPPENS AFTER CONGRESS RECEIVES OBAMA'S BUDGET?</p><p>This is a request to Congress for funds to pay for everything from federal retirement benefits to military programs,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), law enforcement and space exploration.</p><p>But members of Congress, especially those not from the president's own political party, often describe the president's budget this way: "Dead on arrival."</p><p>Even some members of the president's own party have different priorities for spending and taxes.</p><p>Nevertheless, submission of the president's budget kicks off a series of hearings on Capitol Hill where administration officials and outside experts offer their views on the programs Obama is requesting.</p><p>DOES THE BUDGET EVER GET ENACTED INTO LAW?</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>After budget committees in the House of Representatives and Senate wrap up their hearings on the president's budget,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), they try to produce their own budget blueprints.</p><p>If the committees succeed,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/"), the full House and full Senate will vote on those budgets, possibly as early as March or April. But these measures are called "resolutions," meaning they are not bills that eventually get sent to the president for signing into law.</p><p>THEN WHY BOTHER PASSING A BUDGET RESOLUTION?</p><p>These resolutions are important because if passed by Congress, they provide marching instructions to other committees, which then try to write legislation that can be enacted into law.</p><p>Once the appropriations committees get their budget instructions, they will try to write a dozen separate bills to fund programs. It's as if the budget committees set up checking accounts and the appropriations committees write the checks.</p><p>Republicans who control the House want the FY12 budget resolution to require steep spending cuts. But some are concerned that if Obama is presented with spending bills that are too austere, there could be a deadlock that could even lead to government shutdowns toward the end of this year.</p><p>Tax- writing committees in Congress also play an important role in trying to implement new tax cuts or tax increases called for in a budget resolution.</p><p>HOW DOES THE DEBT LIMIT FIT INTO ALL OF THIS?</p><p>The Treasury Department has told Congress that between early April and late May the government could bump up against a $14.3 trillion statutory limit on borrowing.</p><p>The administration wants Congress to quickly raise the limit. Failure to do so, it warns, could force the government to default on loans which could spark a global financial crisis.</p><p>Some Republicans want to include language in a debt limit bill tying it to the budget resolution, and want a budget resolution with spending cuts that they know Obama wouldn't swallow. Senate Democrats likely will work to change whatever budget the House passes,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), but there are worries that a congressional budget blueprint with too many spending cuts could prompt Obama to veto a debt limit bill. It's a highly unlikely scenario, but one that could rattle markets in coming weeks.</p><p>(Editing by Sandra Maler)</p> Politics Small Business Money Barack ObamaRelated Theme Articles:

# Netherlands political crisis casts cloud on euro zone

<p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands, a core euro zone member, was drawn into Europe's debt crisis at the weekend when the government failed to agree on budget cuts, making elections almost unavoidable and casting doubt on its support for future euro zone measures.</p> <p>Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose centre-right coalition has been in power since October 2010, said on Saturday that crucial talks on budget cuts had collapsed after his ally Geert Wilders refused to do a deal, and that new elections were inevitable.</p><p>In the short term, the government must seek support for budget cuts from the opposition parties.</p><p>But uncertainty over the makeup of a new government, and waning voter support for bailouts and austerity measures, raised questions over Dutch backing for a fiscal responsibility pact seen as crucial to helping Europe cope with its debt crisis.</p><p>The catalyst for the crisis was Wilders, who refused to agree to 14-to-16 billion euros ($18.5-$21.1 billion) of budget cuts needed to bring a bloated budget deficit under control.</p><p>Now the euro-skeptic, anti-immigration politician has threatened to fight his campaign on a European battleground.</p><p>"The Freedom Party benches are unanimously against Brussels diktats and the attack on our elderly," Wilders tweeted on Sunday, later telling Dutch news agency ANP that Europe would be in "sharp focus" during any coming election campaign.</p><p>Wilders most recently has lobbied to jettison the euro and return to the guilder, the old Dutch currency, and he is against immigration not only of Muslims but also of Poles and other central and eastern European members of the EU - views that strike a chord with his supporters.</p><p>His Freedom Party had a pact to support Rutte's minority government in parliament, giving it the majority to pass legislation, but after seven weeks of budget talks, Wilders suddenly backed out just when a deal appeared close.</p><p>His supporters are against budget cuts, particularly cuts in welfare, health and unemployment benefits.</p><p>"This was a package that would damage our economy over coming years and increase unemployment. And all that to meet a demand made by Brussels, accepted by the Liberals, of reaching a 3 percent deficit in 2013," he said on Saturday.</p><p>FRAGMENTED POLITICAL FIELD</p><p>An opinion poll published on Sunday showed the Netherlands remains highly fragmented politically, suggesting that it could prove difficult to form a new coalition quickly and that Wilders's chances of forming a new government were slim.</p><p>The Maurice de Hond poll, conducted after the budget talks collapsed, showed that no single party would have a majority if elections were held now,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), though Rutte's Liberal Party has strengthened its lead, followed closely by two leftist parties.</p><p>The poll also showed that a majority favor smaller budget cuts than those stipulated by the European Union,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), a further sign that the notoriously frugal Dutch are suffering from "bailout fatigue" and resent the high cost of rescuing profligate peripheral euro zone countries.</p><p>"Voters from different parties share the same view - disgust or disappointment over the political action and the political parties," De Hond said in a statement, adding that two thirds of those polled agreed with the statement: "I'm tired of all the party politics".</p><p>Asked whether the Netherlands should cut less than the European Union wants, 57 percent of respondents agreed. Supporters of the populist Freedom Party and of the leftist Socialist Party were particularly set against cuts.</p><p>The poll showed the Dutch were most strongly opposed to spending cuts that would have a direct impact on standards of living, 56 percent of respondents opposing the introduction of a new, modest prescription charge, and 47 percent opposing an increase in value added tax.</p><p>The cabinet is set to meet on Monday to discuss what it should do next to agree a budget and whether to resign. The Queen could accept its resignation,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), paving the way for elections, or ask the prime minister to form a new coalition.</p><p>If elections are called, Rutte's Liberals would win 33 seats in the 150-seat parliament,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), up from 31 now, the poll showed, followed by the eurosceptic Socialist Party with 30 seats and the pro-Europe Labour Party with 24 seats.</p><p>Rutte's coalition partner, the Christian Democrats, and the Freedom Party, until Saturday his main ally, have both slipped in the polls and would win 11 and 19 seats respectively.</p><p>BUDGET SINNERS</p><p>Rutte and Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager - who flew back from IMF talks in Washington when the crisis broke - are among the euro zone's harshest critics of "budget sinners" like Greece and Portugal, and the Netherlands is seen as close to Germany in calling for tough austerity measures.</p><p>That is about to change.</p><p>"The Netherlands can no longer be a role model to others. There may be a reaction in other countries: 'If they don't do it, why should we?' This risk exists, which is unpleasant,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/")," said Jaap Koelewijn, an economist and professor of corporate finance.</p><p>The annual budget cuts Wilders has balked at are needed for the Netherlands to meet European Commission targets. Without them, its public deficit is forecast to hit 4.6 percent of GDP in 2013, well above the 3 percent agreed with the Commission.</p><p>If the Netherlands does not cut spending and breaks EU budget rules, it is likely to lose its coveted triple-A credit rating, leading to higher borrowing costs.</p><p>The level of state debt rose to 65.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 from 62.9 percent in 2010, Statistics Netherlands said last month.</p><p>Ratings agency Fitch recently warned the Netherlands it must get its finances in order or risk a ratings downgrade,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), while in a report last month, Citibank went as far as to say it no longer deserved to be considered a core member of the euro zone because of its fiscal woes.</p><p>The uncertainty over budget cuts and reforms, and the time it takes to organize elections, will probably lead to higher interest rates and higher yields on Dutch government bonds.</p><p>"The cost of finance for the Netherlands will go up slightly compared to Germany, but our debt is mostly long-term.

# Insight ECB preparing to close liquidity floodgates

<p>FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Central Bank wants its second offer of cheap ultra-long funds next week to be its last, putting the onus back on governments to secure the euro zone's longer-term future.</p> <p>Powerful members of the central bank's 23-man governing council are privately hoping demand at the February 29 auction will fall well short of the 1 trillion euros some expect, backing their view that it should be the last.</p><p>Central bank sources say they are worried that banks will become too reliant on ECB funds,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), removing the incentive to restart lending between themselves.</p><p>The ECB first offered banks low cost three-year money in December to stave off a freeze in interbank lending that threatened to make the region's debt crisis much worse.</p><p>Banks flocked to take advantage of the offer, filling their coffers, and ECB President Mario Draghi said "a major, major credit crunch" had been averted.</p><p>Some European officials have been hoping the central bank would carry on supporting the economy with a series of subsequent cheap money auctions, known as LTROs.</p><p>But the ECB wants to keep pressure on governments to improve their defense of the euro zone with better economic policies and by bolstering their European Stability Mechanism (ESM) firewall which will come into being by mid- year.</p><p>Making hundreds of billions of euros easily available to banks over a three-year period also risks fuelling a credit binge that some central bankers worry could push up inflation.</p><p>The ECB funneled banks nearly half a trillion euros in cash at the first operation on December 21\. A Reuters poll of over 60 economists showed a mid-range expectation for it to allot another 492 billion euros next week with some expecting up to a trillion to be taken.</p><p>TOO GENEROUS</p><p>The first LTRO, or longer-term refinancing operation, has already eased market pressures.</p><p>Borrowing costs for Italy and Spain - at the epicenter of the crisis last year - have fallen, while parts of the interbank lending market have reopened and stock markets have rallied.</p><p>Only 15 out of 63 analysts polled by Reuters said banks would bid in the second auction because they needed the cash to shore up their own balance sheets.

# GE Capital CEO says European risks manageable

<p>(Reuters) - General Electric Co's (GE.N) finance arm expects Europe's financial woes to take a toll on its profitability but regards the risk as "manageable," the unit's head, Michael Neal, told an investor conference on Thursday.</p> <p>"If trends continue - and there is no reason to think they won't - in Europe, we will come under some pressure.

# Government sues AT&T over fees from misuse of deaf service

<p>(Reuters) - The government charged AT&T Inc (T.N) with cheating it out of millions of dollars by knowingly failing to prevent swindlers from using a subsidized telephone service meant for deaf people.</p> <p>The Justice Department said on Thursday it accused AT&T of billing for reimbursement of calls placed by ineligible international callers who used the service for purposes such as buying goods from merchants using stolen credit cards.</p><p>In a filing Wednesday in federal court in Pennsylvania, the Justice Department joined a whistleblower suit filed by a former worker at one of AT&T's call centers.</p><p>The deaf and hard-of-hearing in the United States are offered a service at no charge to place calls to hearing individuals through text messages over the Internet that are relayed by employees of a so-called IP Relay provider.</p><p>These providers,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com

# Pre-summit document presses EU banking union

<p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders will discuss specific steps towards a cross-border banking union, closer fiscal integration and the possibility of a debt redemption fund at a summit on June 28-29, according to a document prepared for the meeting.</p> <p>Two officials familiar with the 10-15 page document, drawn up over the past month and which is still being revised ahead of the summit, said it sets out in detail the four "pillars" required for a strong economic and monetary union which leaders believe is necessary to secure the currency project's future.</p><p>As well as progress towards a banking union, the paper discusses the need for a more integrated budget policy, steps required for deeper economic integration, and how to retain "democratic legitimacy" if countries give up some sovereignty.</p><p>The document has been drafted by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, and Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup countries using the euro.</p><p>European leaders have already said the first area they need to work on is a banking integration as they try to break the link between bad banks and indebted governments, with the worsening situation in Spain an immediate concern.</p><p>EU officials believe that could be achieved in a year, although Berlin wants to see much more progress towards fiscal integration first, something that would require much longer due to the need to change the European Union treaty to achieve it.</p><p>The document goes into most detail on the banking proposals, setting out the need for a single European banking supervisor, a common EU deposit-guarantee scheme and a single bank-resolution fund to wind down the region's bad banks, the officials said.</p><p>The paper sets out options under each heading, saying that when it comes to a single banking supervisor it could either be charged with overseeing all EU banks, or else look after the major systemic banks with cross-border operations, while another body looks after broader, day-to-day oversight.</p><p>The expectation is the ECB will eventually be given sole responsibility for overseeing Europe's biggest banks, while the European Banking Authority watchdog retains a broader oversight role along with coordinating the work of national regulators.</p><p>On a common deposit insurance mechanism, the paper suggests that there needs to be a strengthening of and closer integration among national guarantee schemes to provide a more reassuring backstop across the whole European Union.</p><p>On a resolution fund to deal with failing banks, it calls for a single mechanism "with a large envelope" that would be financed via levies on the banking sector, such as a financial transaction tax,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), and would offer "an integrated EU solution for resolution".</p><p>The document,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), which draws heavily on proposals made by the European Commission on June 6, says an "immediate and permanent mutualisation" of risk may be required to backstop the banking sector. It suggests the euro zone's permanent ESM bailout fund could be used to recapitalize banks directly, rather than having to lend to governments for on-lending to banks.</p><p>All of those proposals would be possible under existing EU treaties and could be implemented relatively rapidly, the document indicates.</p><p>Even if it took only a year, this will probably not come quick enough to ease market pressure on Spain and Italy that is now reaching danger levels, although some analysts believe a strong signal of intent could help. That could also persuade the ECB to step in.</p><p>"Short term, there is clearly a risk that the summit will disappoint markets yet again. If that were to be the case, I have no doubt that the ECB will step in," said Erik Neilsen, global chief economist at Unicredit.</p><p>That could take the form of an interest rate cut, further easing of collateral rules for Spanish banks so they can continue to access ECB funds or even a resumption of the bank's bond-buying program, which several of its policymakers oppose, he said.</p><p>BUDGET INTEGRATION</p><p>In a second section examining the steps required for closer fiscal coordination, the document says there is a need to go beyond existing legislative proposals such as the fiscal treaty, which 25 of the EU's 27 countries have signed up to and which commits them to a balanced budget.</p><p>The paper says that as closer banking and fiscal integration is achieved, the issue of mutualisation of debt will become more immediate and it raises the option of a debt redemption fund along the lines of that proposed by Germany's "wise men".</p><p>That is an idea that France, Italy and others have pushed hard for but which German Chancellor Angela Merkel opposes.</p><p>Merkel has not ruled out a sharing of debt per se, but has said any discussion on it can only happen at the end of a long process of integration that is likely to take many years. In contrast, France will find it difficult to stomach the loss of sovereignty that fiscal union would demand.</p><p>"The political leaders are now trying to move to a degree of fiscal and political union within a very short period of time. In democracies, such changes usually take a few years, and whether enough can be achieved in time remains to be seen,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," Neilsen said.</p><p>"However, in my mind,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), this does not imply an imminent risk of a breakdown of the euro zone ... It's a political project, and political leaders are unlikely to throw in the towel because markets don't like the policies."</p><p>Other sections of the document discuss the broader aims of greater EU labor mobility,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), efforts to improve pan-EU competitiveness,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), and to examine common taxation such as a common corporate tax base and a financial transactions levy.</p><p>There is likely to be heated discussion on issues such as debt mutualisation and any pooling of liability under a banking union, with Germany adamant that it will not be put on the line to underwrite the liabilities of other euro zone countries.</p><p>No decisions are expected at the summit, but if leaders agree that there are grounds to push ahead, Barroso, Van Rompuy and the others will be given a further mandate to develop the ideas in greater detail, including more specific timelines.</p><p>Van Rompuy has said he hopes to have a more thorough set of plans drawn up by the next EU leaders' summit in October or possibly the one after in December.</p><p>(Writing by Luke Baker; Editing by Ralph Gowling)</p>Related Theme Articles:

# Stocks slip, dollar up as Irish bailout joy fades

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and the greenback rose as investors' optimism about Ireland's 85-billion-euro ($115 billion) debt bailout waned, exposing the unappetizing prospect that Europe's fiscal problems will linger.</p> <p>U.S. Treasuries benefited from both the concerns about Europe's financial health as well as from bond purchases by the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its quantitative easing program.</p><p>Share prices in Tokyo are poised to open higher, extending Monday's five-month closing high.

# Instant view Euro zone March Retail sales fall

<p>n">(Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell sharply in March,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), pointing to weaker household demand, but sales in February were revised upwards,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), data showed on Wednesday.</p> <p>ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS</p><p>CARSTEN BRZESKI, ECONOMIST AT ING</p><p>"The numbers are weakish and there is the regional divergence between the core countries where labor markets are improving and the periphery.</p><p>On the bigger picture level -- first quarter GDP growth should be good, but the recovery remains mainly industry-driven and not broadly based.</p><p>Retail sales now would be slightly down on the quarter, but then retail sales are the most volatile numbers, and are often revised more than once, so we should take them with a pinch of salt.</p><p>The weakness in private consumption does not come as a surprise if you see that inflation has been picking up -- energy prices and food prices -- consumers are the first to feel that.</p><p>But the data will not have any impact on ECB monetary policy-- if anything, the numbers would point to a deflationary impact from the higher food prices an energy, but this was known already last month and the month before and the ECB still started its tightening cycle."</p><p>HOWARD ARCHER, ECONOMIST AT IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT</p><p>"Even allowing for the fact that retail sales were likely dragged down in March by the later Easter in 2011, the drop is disappointing given the importance of consumer spending to growth prospects and the fact that it has been fragile through the euro zone's recovery so far.</p><p>If the euro zone is to see sustained,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), decent growth in 2011, it needs consumers to increasingly step up to the plate. And worryingly, euro zone consumer confidence fell for a second month running in April,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), to be at a nine month low.</p><p>Consumers were more worried about the economic situation and outlook in April and about their personal financial situations, although their concerns over jobs eased. Inflation expectations remained high, but at least stabilized. There was a sharp weakening in the indices relating to consumers' willingness to make purchases at present (fell to a nine-month low) and over the next 12-months (to a six-month low).</p><p>The problem is that in recent times, it has not taken much for euro zone consumers to rein back their spending, and they do currently have significant matters to worry about. On the positive side, euro zone labor markets have shown recent overall modest improvement.</p><p>However,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), purchasing power is being squeezed by rising inflation (euro zone consumer price inflation was at a 30-month high of 2.8 percent in April) and muted wage growth, while tighter fiscal policy is increasingly kicking in across the region.</p><p>Furthermore, despite the recent modest overall improvement in labor markets, the euro zone unemployment rate is still elevated at 9.9 percent and it seems unlikely to fall markedly in the near term at least. On top of this, many consumers have significant worries about their long-term financial positions. As a result,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), consumers' propensity to buy is likely to remain relatively low in many euro zone countries.</p><p>On a positive note, despite the marked drop in its retail sales in March, Germany still seems well placed for a significant pick up in consumer spending in 2011\. Consumers in Germany are benefiting from high and rising employment and higher wage settlements, while it seems likely that there must be an element of pent-up demand after many years of muted spending. Having said that German consumers get particularly worried about inflation so there is still the very real possibility that they will be very careful in their spending for now at least."</p>Related Theme Articles:

# Fed's Fisher sees no need for more monetary easing

<p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - The economy is in much better shape and does not need further help from the central bank,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), a top Federal Reserve official known for his hawkish policy views said on Thursday.</p> <p>Although growth is "slower than we would like,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/")," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told Fox Business Network, "it's gaining momentum."</p><p>"We will not support further quantitative easing under these circumstances because there's a lot of money lying on the sidelines, lying fallow," he said according to a transcript provided by the network. "We don't need any more monetary morphine."</p><p>The Fed has kept benchmark interest rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought $2.3 trillion in bonds to stimulate growth,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), a program known as quantitative easing.</p><p>At its March policy meeting, the Fed nodded to recent economic improvement but reiterated concerns about high unemployment and its expectation that subpar economic performance will require keeping rates near zero through late 2014.</p><p>Among analysts and investors, however,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), expanding manufacturing and improving labor markets in recent months have lifted hopes for recovery. In February unemployment was at a three-year low of 8.3 percent. The housing sector also appears poised to improve, with permits for homebuilding this week approaching a 3-1/2-year high.</p><p>Traders have reacted by betting the Fed will start raising rates as soon as July 2013.</p><p>Fisher, who is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), said he is not worried about inflation, which he expects to come down to around the Fed's 2 percent target.</p><p>"The real problem in our country is job creation and prosperity,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/")," he said. "And we need to get better fiscal policy to complement what we at the Fed have done, because it's not working as effectively as it should."</p><p>With rates near zero, pushing borrowing costs lower simply will not create more jobs, Fisher said.</p><p>"I don't see what more would do," Fisher said.

# Germany builds core group for transactions tax

<p>LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Germany will work with a core group of European Union countries on introducing a financial transactions tax, its finance minister said on Friday, after efforts to get an agreement among all 27 EU countries fell short.</p> <p>Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said 10 countries were prepared to use an EU process known as 'enhanced cooperation' to push ahead with developing the tax,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), which Britain and other states, including some in the euro zone, oppose.</p><p>Enhanced cooperation requires at least 9 EU countries to agree to work on a proposal. France, Italy and Spain are all behind Germany with the initiative, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after a meeting with her counterparts in Rome.</p><p>Revenue from such a tax, which some analysts estimate could raise more than 50 billion euros a year depending on the number of countries that participate, could be used to finance initiatives such as a fund to wind down bad banks.</p><p>"My impression is that quite a number of member states strongly support the proposal of an FTT (Financial Transactions Tax) in principle," Schaeuble said after a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. "We should give it a try."</p><p>Denmark, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, has tried for months to broker an agreement on an FTT but acknowledged on Friday that it would not be possible to do it among all 27 countries given the divisiveness of the issue.</p><p>"What was promising was that a number of countries expressed interest in going forward with enhanced cooperation," said Margrethe Vestager, Denmark's minister for economic affairs,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), who added that Schaeuble's mention of 10 countries was about right.</p><p>"If there are nine, the (European) Commission can come up with a new proposal. Nine or more countries have expressed interest in enhanced cooperation," she said.</p><p>So far, the debate about such a tax has centered on a blueprint written by the European Commission for a tax on stocks, bonds and derivatives trades from 2014 that its own research said could raise up to 57 billion euros a year.</p><p>Spain's economy minister said his country stood firmly behind the proposal. "We are determined to start the enhanced cooperation,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," Luis de Guindos told reporters.</p><p>Austria also supports the proposal.</p><p>But many ministers were critical of the idea,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), with some signaling that they could even challenge a smaller group of countries introducing such a tax if it negatively impacted on those not participating.</p><p>"We are not convinced of the case," Michael Noonan,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Ireland's finance minister,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), told the meeting.

# Lingering customers just one hurdle as Starbucks eyes China

<p>LOS ANGELES/BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) is on the rise in China with ambitious expansion plans but like any big new emerging market there are teething problems, not least of which is that customers love it so much, they stay for hours and hours and sometimes don't even buy a drink.</p> <p>Chief Executive Howard Schultz expects mainland China to overtake Canada as Starbucks' second-largest market by 2014 and some analysts believe it could one day rival the United States as the company's biggest market.</p><p>"For a decade the core business was expats and tourists. Without question, the core business today is Chinese nationals," Schultz told Reuters ahead of a trip to Beijing and Shanghai to meet store managers.</p><p>The world's biggest coffee chain is a symbol of Western affluence in a nation of tea drinkers. But the tendency for Chinese visitors to linger in cafes and their lower income levels means sales volumes are much smaller than the United States and other markets where taking drinks to go is the norm.</p><p>Xu Baoli, a 51-year-old stock trader in Beijing, said he visits Starbucks at least 10 times a month but doesn't go for the coffee. He is taking a break, surfing the Internet and meeting with clients.</p><p>Observers note that Chinese customers will bring sometimes their own food to Starbucks and Xu admits that every so often he doesn't bother to buy anything at all.</p><p>"I like the concept," said Xu. "Chinese people used to think you needed a spoon and saucer to drink coffee. Now, walking around with a Starbucks cup in your hand has become a fashion statement for Chinese."</p><p>With the U.S. market maturing, few prizes are as enticing as China and its population of more than 1.3 billion.</p><p>Starbucks entered China in 1999 and now has more than 570 stores in 48 cities. By 2015,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), it plans over 1,500 stores in 70-plus cities, though that would still only account for about half of China's major cities and would be just a fraction of the 10,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"),800 cafes in the United States.</p><p>"It could very well be exactly what's happening with Yum," Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth Management, referring to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). The U.S. fast-food company got an early foothold in China and now gets more revenue from that market than any other.</p><p>And while Starbucks' China cafes contribute less than 5 percent of company revenue, their store operating profit margins, at around 22 percent, are higher than U.S. cafes because they charge essentially U.S. prices in a market famed for its low labor and other costs.</p><p>HURDLES TO GROWTH</p><p>But even with that big silver lining, there are big impediments to growth including low incomes, rising costs and the fact that most Chinese don't have a coffee habit.</p><p>The market is still small, with specialist coffee shops such as Starbucks booking sales of $358 million from mainland China in 2010, although that was up from $104 million in 2005,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), according to Euromonitor International. By comparison, the United States accounts for $8 billion in revenue for Starbucks.</p><p>Consumers in China drink an average of just three cups of coffee per year, according to an industry study,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), while for many Starbucks prices are simply out of reach.</p><p>Based on average wages in China,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/ "http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/"), it would take 1.3 hours of work in the more affluent east of China to buy a Starbucks tall (12-ounce) caramel macchiato. That goes up to 1.6 hours in the west and 1.9 hours in central China, says Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore.</p><p>Affordability remains a top concern for analysts, who worry that as Starbucks' expansion progresses beyond the country's biggest cities it will be less able raise prices to protect margins.</p><p>But CEO Schultz said income has not been a barrier to growth, adding that Starbucks' shops in non-core markets perform "as well or better" than stores in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, helped by pent-up demand.</p><p>Attracting quality employees when competition for skilled workers is intensifying as other chains also seek to expand, is also very difficult, says Paul French,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), chief China analyst for market research firm Mintel.</p><p>To that end, Starbucks has announced plans to launch a training program called Starbucks China University next year.

# European bank bonus cuts mask basic pay hikes

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - European banks could face more pressure from regulators and politicians worried that big cuts in bonuses have barely dented a high-pay culture sustained by massive hikes in base salaries.</p> <p>A string of banks have grabbed headlines with big reductions in handouts to staff for 2011\. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), 82 percent state- owned after a government bailout, is to cut its bonus payouts for 2011 by 58 percent.</p><p>French bank Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) will lower trader bonuses by 20 percent and larger rivals BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) have pledged cuts of 50 percent.</p><p>It said although RBS made a loss in 2011, this reflected the business environment and costs from its legacy business.</p><p>UKFI said RBS management had made progress in improving performance and had "exercised reasonable judgment" in its approach to bonuses.</p><p>But critics say slicing away chunks of bonus pots by banks masks concerns that base salaries and total pay remain too high.</p><p>Some investment banks still hand over nearly half their revenues to staff. Many firms have raised basic pay while cutting annual bonus payments since the crisis.</p><p>At RBS's investment bank arm, the compensation to revenue ratio for 2011 rose to 41 percent from 34 percent in 2010, based on staff costs as a percentage of total income.</p><p>The bank's average total pay, made up of total salary plus bonus, for its investment bank in 2011 was down 26 percent,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), a much smaller drop than the cut in bonuses alone.</p><p>Bankers have become a focus for public anger over the financial crisis, which tipped economies into recession and left governments with huge debts.</p><p>Regulators and politicians have pushed banks to cut back on bonuses as a result.</p><p>Bankers,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com

"Pay isn't what it was and with so much deferred you don't see a lot of it for years but it is still just as hard work,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), and you are vilified by everyone."</p><p>Bankers' bonus expectations were already low because of the political and regulatory pressures.</p><p>But business have also suffered from the euro zone crisis,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), leading to thousands of job cuts across the industry.</p><p>"People are not expecting a good year.

# Fleet age a key factor in rising Transocean costs

<p>(Reuters) - The early move by Transocean Ltd (RIG.N) (RIGN.VX) into deepwater drilling is now translating into relatively higher costs for the industry leader as its rigs need to meet tougher regulatory standards for equipment.</p> <p>Ballooning maintenance costs contributed to the sixth straight quarterly disappointment from the offshore drilling contractor, and its shares tumbled nearly 13 percent on Thursday as concerns crept in about its dividend as well.</p><p>Shares of rival Ensco Plc (ESV.N), with a largely brand-new ultra-deepwater fleet, rose sharply after its third-quarter results came in ahead of expectations.</p><p>An Ensco executive also reported no significant problems in getting its fleet to meet new equipment standards, which have been tightened in response to the Gulf of Mexico disaster in April 2010 that destroyed Transocean's Deepwater Horizon.</p><p>Transocean Chief Executive Steven Newman said his company's "historical leadership" in deepwater drilling meant its older rigs bore a disproportionate amount of the cost of stronger regulations.</p><p>"Two-thirds of our fleet comes from prior newbuild cycles. As far as the peer group is concerned, only one-third of their fleet comes from prior newbuild cycles," Newman told analysts on a call to discuss quarterly results.</p><p>"Everybody else is a bit later to the game than we are."</p><p>Newman also said it was taking longer to get equipment certified by original manufacturers such as Cameron International Corp (CAM.N),[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N) and GE Oil & Gas (GE.N), because their facilities were overwhelmed with getting so much work all at once.</p><p>While Transocean started with maintenance and equipment certification work on its lucrative ultra-deepwater fleet, next year it would focus on rigs that work in shallower waters.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Ricardo Rosa said this would mean less of a revenue hit,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), even if the work cost the same or more, and he offered "highly preliminary" operating and maintenance expenses guidance for 2012 of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion.</p><p>This would be an increase from 2011, when he expected comparable expenses of $5.8 billion to $6 billion, which is up $200 million from previous guidance, and represents the second increase in 2011 cost guidance in three months.</p><p>Both Newman and Rosa fielded questions on the outlook for Transocean's dividend given the rising costs and its recent $1.4 billion takeover of Norway's Aker Drilling, and their less-than-assured answers led to a further drop in the stock.</p><p>Newman said board discussions would begin on the dividend in the next few weeks, with a final decision in February.</p><p>"We have indicated that we are committed to a sustained dividend," Rosa said. "But clearly we have to take all of the externalities into account."</p><p>Analysts differed in their interpretations of Transocean's adjusted third-quarter earnings per share,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), excluding one-time items, but some put the figure in the range of 23 to 27 cents. Analysts on average had expected 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p><p>Ensco earned 87 cents per share in the quarter,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), compared with the average estimate of 82 cents.</p><p>Shares of Transocean, which had already lost a fifth of their value in 2011, were down 12.8 percent at $48.84 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Ensco, which had been down 9 percent this year, were up 6.7 percent at $52.10.</p><p>Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) managed to beat profit estimates last month,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), though partly at the expense of its fourth quarter, while rival Noble Corp (NE.N) overcame disappointing numbers with an upbeat outlook.</p><p>(Reporting by Braden Reddall in San Francisco,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), editing by Matthew Lewis)</p> Related Quotes and News Company Price Related NewsRelated Theme Articles:

# Maybe no housing rebound for a generation Shiller

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Housing market is likely to remain weak and may take a generation or more to rebound,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Yale economics professor Robert Shiller told Reuters Insider on Tuesday.</p> <p>Shiller,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), the co-creator of the Standard & Poor's/Case- Shiller home price index,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), said a weak labor market,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com

# Factbox How do you change a treaty

<p>n">(Reuters) - The European Union was divided over how to defuse a sovereign debt crisis going into a do-or-die summit that starts with an informal dinner in Brussels on Thursday evening.</p> <p>Paris and Berlin need to win backing for their plan to amend the EU's Lisbon treaty to toughen budget discipline, if they are to have it ready as they hope by March.</p><p>If all 27 EU states do not support more fiscal union by adapting the Lisbon treaty, which took eight years to negotiate,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), then Sarkozy and Merkel want the 17 euro zone countries to go ahead alone with more integration.</p><p>Here are details of what some EU nations would have to do to enable changes to the Lisbon Treaty:</p><p> _AUSTRIA: - Any EU treaty changes that require amendments to Austria's constitution would have to be adopted with a two-thirds majority in parliament. Officials have said any move toward creating a fiscal union in the EU would trigger a referendum.</p><p>- Parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty in April 2007.</p><p>_ BELGIUM: - A treaty change of the magnitude of the Lisbon Treaty needs to be approved by 9 parliamentary bodies.</p><p>- A spokesman for the Belgian federal parliament said that in the past this complexity had not been an issue as both the Lisbon treaty and the European constitutional treaty, which was later blocked by referendums in France and the Netherlands, were ratified in time. A referendum is not possible in Belgium.</p><p> _BULGARIA/ROMANIA: - In both Romania and Bulgaria only a simple parliamentary majority is needed to back any EU treaty change. Both countries passed the Lisbon Treaty quickly and with little debate.</p><p>_ CYPRUS: - A parliamentary vote is required and is normally a formality. The Lisbon Treaty was swiftly approved.</p><p> _CZECH REPUBLIC: - The Czech Republic would need parliamentary approval for a treaty change. It would also have to be signed off by eurosceptic President Vaclav Klaus. Klaus legally cannot refuse to sign a treaty approved by parliament, but the constitution does not prescribe any deadlines, so he could stretch out the process.</p><p>- Klaus had refused to sign the Lisbon Treaty and was the last EU leader to sign in November 2009\. Klaus's second and final term runs out in February 2012.</p><p>_ DENMARK: - Under Denmark's constitution,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), international treaties can be entered into only with the consent of parliament. Denmark ratified the Lisbon Treaty by passing a regular bill in parliament in April 2008,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), without a referendum.</p><p>- If there were to be a transfer of authority to EU federal institutions, then a referendum would be needed in Denmark after the legislation is adopted in parliament.</p><p> _ESTONIA: - Estonia needs a parliamentary vote for amendments to the treaty. The Lisbon treaty took four months to be passed by Estonia's parliament.</p><p>_ FINLAND: - The Finnish parliament plays a strong role in decision-making on EU affairs compared with many other member states, and a treaty change would require approval by a majority. However, parliament's position on EU issues are generally decided by the Grand Committee. Finland's parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008, with 150 of 200 parliamentary votes in favor.</p><p> _FRANCE: - In France, the president can decide whether to submit a vote on changes to the Lisbon Treaty to parliament - known as a "congress" - or to a referendum. After the French rejected the EU constitution in 2005, the president moved the vote to the parliament, which approved it.</p><p>- After coming to power in 2007,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to opt for a parliamentary ratification to avoid the risk of a second rejected referendum.</p><p>_ GERMANY: - To ratify any treaty changes, both Germany's lower and upper houses of parliament must give their approval and the president must then rubber stamp the legislation.</p><p>- Germany was among the last four EU states to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in September 2009, when legislation was delayed for more than a year following an appeal to the country's Constitutional Court by a group of lawmakers.</p><p> _GREECE: - Greece ratifies international treaties, including ones on EU matters,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), in parliament. Theoretically, they can also be ratified by referendum but this has never happened.</p><p>- Greece ratified the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008.</p><p>_ HUNGARY: - To approve any possible EU treaty change, the government submits a bill to parliament, which will have to be endorsed by two-thirds of all lawmakers to become law. Hungary became the first of the 27 EU countries to ratify the treaty in a parliamentary vote on December 17, 2007.</p><p> _IRELAND: - The Irish are entitled to vote on fundamental changes to EU treaties and the government has admitted it would struggle to get new reforms past an electorate still stung by Europe's hardline stance on the cost and make-up of Ireland's EU-IMF bailout. The government has said it will seek legal advice about whether a referendum will be needed when it has more details of the proposed changes.</p><p>- Irish voters held up the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty when they rejected it in 2009\. It was passed in 2010.</p><p>_ ITALY: - Approval of any change to a treaty would be through a vote in both houses of parliament. Italy approved the Lisbon Treaty in July 2008 through a unanimous vote in the lower house of parliament. The Senate had approved the treaty a week earlier. Formal ratification occurred on August 8\. It was the first time that a European treaty had been approved unanimously in both houses of parliament.</p><p> _LATVIA: - Changes to treaties require a parliamentary approval. However, the constitution says that more than half of the 100-member parliament can demand a referendum on any "significant" changes to treaties that guide Latvia's participation in the European Union.</p><p>_ LITHUANIA: - Treaty changes are approved by parliament. Parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty in May 2008 after just two months. However an official said that depending on what is proposed, Lithuania may need to alter the country's constitutional law which needs a bigger majority.</p><p> _NETHERLANDS: - A treaty change will have to be put to a parliamentary vote, but would not require a referendum. The Lisbon Treaty was put to a vote in parliament in 2007.</p><p>_ POLAND: - Poland does not require a referendum to change the EU Treaty as long as the change does not force an amendment to the constitution.</p><p>- The change is very likely to be endorsed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist, pro-European cabinet. It then requires the parliament's approval before President Bronislaw Komorowski - a close Tusk ally - signs it into law.</p><p>- The same procedure took place when the Lisbon Treaty was approved in Poland.</p><p> _PORTUGAL: - There is no formal requirement in Portugal for a treaty change to be put through a referendum. However the government can decide at any point to hold a referendum, seeking greater legitimacy for controversial or sensitive measures.</p><p>- The Lisbon Treaty only required parliamentary approval and passed easily in April 2008.</p><p>_ SLOVAKIA: - Parliament needs to approve any changes in international treaties with a constitutional majority,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), which means at least 90 votes out of total 150.</p><p>- Slovakia approved the Lisbon Treaty in April 2008 after weeks of political bickering among opposition and coalition parties over domestic non-related issues.</p><p> _SPAIN: - The Lisbon treaty was ratified by Spain's lower house of parliament in June 2008 and then by the upper house in an extraordinary session in July 2008\. Royal approval was given days later on July 30, 2008\. A parliamentary vote would be needed for any changes as a result of the December 9 summit.</p><p>_ SWEDEN: - Parliament would need to approve any changes to the EU treaty. The sitting coalition government does not have a majority and would need opposition support to pass such a change. Sweden approved the Lisbon Treaty in a parliamentary vote in November 2008.</p><p>* UNITED KINGDOM: - The European Union Act, which came into force in July 2011, states that any proposed future EU treaty or amendment to existing treaties and ratchet clauses that transfer competences or power from the UK to the EU would require a referendum, although the government has said proposals currently under discussion in Brussels do not fall into that bracket. An act of UK parliament is required before any EU law can take effect in Britain.</p><p>- Limited treaty changes which do not transfer powers from London to Brussels must still be approved by an act of parliament before the UK can agree to them

- this used to be just a vote in both houses of parliament.</p><p>- Britain says a treaty just between 17 countries would not need to be considered by parliament, but one between all 27 in the bloc would. The UK officially ratified the Lisbon Treaty in July 2008 after parliament voted it into law the month before.</p><p>Source: Reuters Bureaux (Reporting by David Cutler, London Editorial Reference Unit)</p>Related Theme Articles:

# Weak euro zone casts long shadows

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Drug dealers, money launderers and assorted cash- only criminals love the convenience of the 500 euro note. Will bankers also soon be clamoring for wads of the high-value bill?</p> <p>The question arises because the European Central Bank might have to lower interest rates further to revive growth. Business surveys this week are likely to show the euro zone economy remaining flat on its back in August after contracting by 0.2 percent in the second quarter.</p><p>But the ECB has already cut to zero the interest it pays banks on excess reserves. So driving the deposit rate into negative territory -- charging banks for the privilege of parking surplus funds -- would force lenders to weigh up the alternative of withdrawing cash and stashing it somewhere safe.</p><p>The idea sounds outlandish. Not so. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure addressed it back in February.</p><p>"Given the costs associated with holding large amounts of banknotes, it is likely that significantly negative interest rates would be required to trigger a switch from money holding to investment in banknotes," Coeure said.</p><p>Since then, the economic recovery the ECB was anticipating has failed to materialize, prompting the move to a zero deposit rate and leading economists to take a closer look at the cost of warehousing notes.</p><p>"The physical storage would be easy; if withdrawn as 500 euro notes,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), 1 billion euros (plus two big security guards) would easily fit into a VW Golf and the cash into existing bank safes. Harder to gauge are the inconvenience and insurance-type costs, which will affect banks' response," Greg Fuzesi of JP Morgan wrote in a note.</p><p>Lasse Holboell Nielsen, an economist with Goldman Sachs, has examined the case of non-euro member Denmark, whose central bank set a deposit rate of minus 0.2 percent over a month ago, to tease out the implications for the euro zone.</p><p>For a bank with 40 billion Danish crowns ($6.60 billion) on deposit,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), he reckons it would make economic sense to take out cash once the interest rate drops below -0.52 percent or -0.65 percent, depending on the fixed-cost assumptions for insurance, transport and vault rental.</p><p>Because Denmark's central bank has not encountered any unexpected fallout since it went negative, Nielsen concludes that it could cut the deposit rate by another quarter-point.</p><p>And based on Denmark's experience, he judges a negative deposit rate at the ECB of 0.25 percent is quite feasible.</p><p>ALL EYES ON THE CENTRAL BANKS</p><p>Steen Jakobsen,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), chief economist with Saxo Bank in Copenhagen, said he expected a weak euro zone purchasing mangers' survey on Thursday would ratchet up the pressure on ECB President Mario Draghi to act.</p><p>"If anything, it will support the argument that Draghi feels the need to do something about the monetary transmission mechanism because the numbers will just continue to weaken," Jakobsen said.</p><p>In particular, he said a marked slowdown in China, which also releases a poll of purchasing executives on Thursday, boded ill for exports from Germany, Europe's biggest economy.</p><p>A survey conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce and Germany's IFO institute, released last week,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-

# Nightmare of disorderly default focuses minds on Greece

<p>ATHENS (Reuters) - Argentina's chaotic bankruptcy a decade ago triggered riots, looting and dozens of deaths. The prospect of that horror scenario playing out in Greece is focusing minds across Europe as the threat of default remains all too real.</p> <p>At best, if private creditors walk away from a voluntary debt restructuring, a disorderly default would shut Greek banks for days to give Athens time to prevent a bank run by reassuring depositors that the lenders will not go bust.</p><p>At worst, if EU partners also pull the plug,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com

I would have nothing to sell. How would I survive?" 66-year old shop manager Antonis Broukias asked in his old- fashioned books and stationery store in central Athens.</p><p>"I will surely shut down my shop, especially if we return to the drachma," Broukias said, adding that he was worried protests could turn violent.</p><p>Athens and its private creditors are scrambling to avoid a messy default that could drag the whole euro zone into a much deeper crisis. But talks have stalled and the clock is ticking down to a major bond redemption due in late March.</p><p>Even if a deal is struck, Greece's EU and IMF lenders have made clear they will not sanction a 130 billion euros bailout package unless Athens pushes through more budget cuts and implements a series of long-agreed austerity reforms. If unimpressed, they could pull the plug on aid at any time.</p><p>The fate of Greek people and businesses if there is no deal with private creditors, who are being asked to take hefty losses as part of the new bailout, largely depends on whether the EU,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), European Central Bank and IMF - tired with Athens' failure to meet reform targets - would stand by Greece.</p><p>If they don't, people worried that the banks might shut or their deposits could be turned into a new currency would likely rush to get their money out, prompting a run on the banks.</p><p>That would be the first and most visible effect of a crisis that would hit the whole country of about 11 million people, which has just entered its fifth consecutive year of deep recession and depends on external support to stay afloat.</p><p>"Leaving the euro would be a disaster," said 73-year old pensioner Petros Haris. "If you ever win the lottery, take it all out of the country!" he said as one of Athens' many street lottery vendors walked by.</p><p>His 30-year-old son, a lawyer who came back from France four years ago to set up his own business, is considering leaving again, he said.</p><p>EURO EXIT?</p><p>Under the worst-case scenario, Athens would struggle to pay pensions and salaries for its bloated public sector.</p><p>Greek banks - which hold around 45 billion euros of junk Greek government bonds - would need to be recapitalized, which would mean nationalization. After a default, they would likely be shut out of ECB borrowing if the bloc's central bank stuck to its rules.</p><p>The financial system would freeze and could force the Mediterranean country, which witnessed a strong economic boom when it joined the euro currency, to seek an exit from the euro zone just a decade later, analysts say.</p><p>"If international lenders pull the plug, there will be a need for a new currency because after a certain point the state would not be able to function without printing money,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," said one Greek banking analyst who did not want to be named.</p><p>"We would face circumstances similar to Argentina, there would be lines outside banks the size of Florida ... It would be tough to stay in the euro after a disorderly default."</p><p>Some argue that a euro exit would help Greece regain its competitiveness leaving it better off in the long run. But central banker George Provopoulos has warned that a return to the drachma would be a nightmare, with a devaluation of the new currency reaching 60-70 percent. [ID:nL6E7NU25R]</p><p>Schools,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), hospitals and other public services would face operational difficulties during a transition period, Provopoulos said, warning of possible shortages of imported goods including fuel, raw materials and even agricultural products.</p><p>"If Greece leaves the euro zone, we'll be looking at a sharp devaluation of the new currency and inflation is going to go through the roof," said Diego Iscaro, senior economist at IHS Global Insight.</p><p>"If external funding collapses, they may not be able to pay for imports, people may not be able to find basic products in supermarkets," he said,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), while it would take a long time for competitiveness to improve.</p><p>A vast majority of Greeks want the country to stay in the euro, although they are angry with wage cuts and tax hikes demanded by the EU and the IMF in return for aid.</p><p>"Our life would be a lot worse if we left the euro. It would be like going back to the 70's, these were tough times," said Yannis Korelis, 60, a public sector worker.</p><p>In the 1970s, large parts of Greece were very poor and tens of thousands left to seek a better life abroad.</p><p>There would be practical problems too. Argentina kept the same currency although it was sharply devalued. If Greece switched back to the drachma, it would have to print it - the design, printing and circulation of the euro took 2-1/2 years, Provopoulos said.</p><p>At the height of the Latin American nation's crisis, provinces started issuing their own script currency to pay pubic employees. In northern Greece, where unemployment is sky-high, some communities have started using alternative currencies such as coupons to barter basic goods or services.</p><p>ANARCHY?</p><p>In Argentina, the bank deposit freeze was the tipping point, triggering mass violent protests. People took to the streets banging pots and pans to protest against an economic collapse that plunged millions into poverty. The government declared a stage of siege and presidents resigned one after another.</p><p>"It was really anarchy," said Iscaro, who now covers countries such as Greece for IHS Global Insight in London but is originally from Argentina and worked in a bank there at the height of the crisis.</p><p>"At the worst of the riots they tried to set the building on fire," Iscaro said. "People in a desperate position would come to the bank and say: 'if you don't give me my money I will kill myself'."</p><p>In Greece, where people angry with austerity and record high unemployment have protested almost daily and pelted politicians with yoghurt and eggs, violence is a risk but it is very hard to predict how bad it will be.</p><p>The country has a long tradition of street protests that can turn violent - three died when a bank was torched down during an anti-austerity protest in 2010 - but rallies have failed to attract a strong turnout in recent months.</p><p>"What we have now is a typical case of manic depression," said Yanis Varoufakis, professor of economics at the University of Athens. "In this situation you go from being catatonic - this is the stage we are in now -- to being extremely agitated and violent. Predicting the switch from one state to the other is impossible for me."</p><p>It is the very prospect anarchy which means the rest of Europe is unlikely to turn its back completely.</p><p>To avoid this worst case scenario and the serious risks of contagion to the rest of the euro zone it entails, the EU is more likely to continue helping Greece and the ECB to support its banks, analysts say.</p><p>"In the back of the mind of northern European decision- makers there is always the fear of instability," said Guillermo Nielsen,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), who as Argentine finance secretary led talks with creditors after the default?.</p><p>"Greece plays very well the geopolitical card ... The rest of Europe will have to foot the bill," he said.</p><p>This would strongly limit the risk of a severe bank run, because Greek banks would still benefit from the guarantee of the European Central Bank's safety net.</p><p>"Watch the banks," said Nielsen. "If the Greek people move forward without panicking and going for their money, you can handle it ... A disorderly default, it's the bank run."</p><p>(Additional reporting by Renee Maltezou, George Georgiopoulos and Lefteris Papadimas, editing by Mike Peacock)</p> World Argentina GreeceRelated Theme Articles:

# Chinese Estates head to be prosecuted in Macau over bribery

<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong tycoon Joseph Lau, who heads developer Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK), will face prosecution over bribery and money laundering in a land deal in Asia's gambling capital, Macau, Chinese Estates said in a statement on Thursday.</p> <p>A court in Macau on Wednesday formally accepted an accusation by the public prosecutor that Lau had a case to answer on the charges, the company said.

# Bond King Bill Gross America Wont Default, but Fiscal Crisi

Schneiderman we won't default on our debt--though it may take a fiscal crisis for Washington to solve our deficit problems.</p><p>For all the talk of and to solve America's long- term budget deficits, the head of the country's largest bond fund says the gridlock in Washington will not ease over the next two years--and that a fiscal crisis may ensue before any real progress occurs. But a U.S. debt default, he says,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), will not be the end result.</p><p>In an interview Wednesday, Bill Gross,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), co-founder of the California-based Pacific Investment Management Company,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), or Pimco, said continued inaction on the budget deficit could lead to an erosion of wealth. "The negative repercussions would be a lower dollar, higher inflation, and artificially low interest rates,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," he said. "All surreptitiously pick the pockets of investors."</p><p>Earlier this week, Standard & Poor's, one of the three main credit rating agencies, lowered its triggering a wave of jitters among investors. In an effort to reassure them, and other White House officials said the nation's credit rating would never fall below triple-A, the highest grade.</p><p>Yet Gross said S&P is only stating the obvious. The fiscal situation of the United States is "God-awful," he said. "Washington talks a big game [but] then goes off doing what it always does--spending money."</p><p>Gross, who has been in touch frequently with the White House and various government officials since the 2008 financial crisis, said he has a deep respect for the lawmakers who are trying to combat the nation's debt problems. Yet at least in part because of the balance of power in Washington and the highly partisan climate, Gross is skeptical that anything constructive will happen before the situation becomes dire. Only a crisis,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"), he said, is likely to break the impasse.</p><p>"The U.S. can't and won't default on its debt," he said.

# Economy Harvard Gets Caught In The Credit Crunch - Newsweek

<p>The recent market turmoil portends hard times for even the wealthiest universities. Last week, Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust stakeholders that,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"), with the research service Moody's projecting "a 30 percent decline in the value of college and university endowments in the current fiscal year," Harvard needs "to be prepared to absorb unprecedented endowment losses and plan for a period of greater financial constraint."</p><p>If any investor could have avoided the credit catastrophe, it should have been Harvard. Harvard, the ultimate long-term investor (it's been compounding assets for more than 350 years),[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), sports the nation's leading business school and counts a host of financial geniuses among its many distinguished alumni. But judging by one snapshot of a portion of Harvard's gigantic endowment, Harvard's recent financial performance is less than impressive.</p><p>The has the enviable but challenging task of managing Harvard's mammoth endowment. As of June 30, 2008, HMC managed more than $45 billion, the vast majority of it endowment assets. (Here's HMC's and data on its .) HMC parcels out big chunks of the endowment to outside managers--hedge funds, private-equity firms, asset managers of all stripes--and its staff manages a large chunk itself.</p><p>Much of the granular data on who manages what and how much Harvard has invested in which assets aren't publicly available. But every quarter, HMC files a 13-F form with the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating a portion of its holdings in publicly traded securities--stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds. The 13-F is a snapshot and is not fully representative of Harvard's overall holdings. But the chunk of the portfolio revealed in the most recent looks like it was chosen by someone who watched a few episodes of CNBC's Squawk Box and heard that the hot new investments were emerging markets, commodities, and private equity.</p><p>The 13-F shows Harvard with some 231 positions worth nearly $2.9 billion,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"), highly concentrated in popped macroeconomic bubble plays. The top 10 holdings,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/ "http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/"), which Bloomberg helpfully breaks out, account for 70 percent of the value of the disclosed holdings. Virtually all of them performed rather poorly in the third quarter,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), and virtually all of them have slid in the weeks since Sept. 30.</p><p>The biggest position disclosed--all amounts and dollar values are as of Sept. 30--was $463 million in the iShares MSCI Emerging Market fund. As the , that fund's off nearly 60 percent from this summer and down by about one-third from the end of September. Third-largest was a $233 million position in Weyerhauser, the wood-products giant that has fallen about 40 percent since the end of September. The top 10 included $232 million in the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), off about 40 percent since the end of September; about $51 million in the iPATH MSCI India Index, off about one- third since the end of September; and $158 million in the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China Index, off about 30 percent since the end of September. For good measure, top 10 holdings also included index funds that were plays on South Africa's commodity-based economy and on the perennially emerging market of Mexico. Would it surprise you to learn that both of those investments, after fairing poorly in the third quarter, have fallen further in the fourth quarter?</p><p>Now, this emerging-market-heavy filing is clearly not representative of Harvard's overall asset-management strategy. As HMC's , the endowment allocated about 11 percent of its total to emerging market stocks. (By contrast, nearly half of the portfolio described in HMC's 13-F was in emerging market stocks.) But it does show that even the best, most experienced, and highly regarded long-term investors can get suckered into new-era thinking and make investments that turn out to be highly risky bets. The 13-F shows that the managers running this Harvard porfolio were huge believers in the decoupling theory--i.e., that emerging markets would continue to thrive even as the United States stalled--and in the notion that commodities would keep booming.</p><p>Why did this belief persist for so long? The answer would make a great Harvard Business School case study.</p>Related Theme Articles:
