Home Business Success Can Be Achieved" )]

##  Home Business Success Can Be Achieved

The majority of entrepreneurs that have attempted a home based business have
failed. This is not a big secret. But why is this? Why do only a few succeed
when so many more fail? What I have learned is that most of the successful
people that you hear about or are introduced to start out as failures
themselves. The main difference between a successful person and one that has
failed is usually years of experience in the industry vs no experience at all.
A new person will get involved with a home business with high expectations of
quick and easy success. Well,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), why
wouldn't they think this way, it's what they are led to believe. Just get
involved and tell people about the opportunity and they will follow. What the
failures quickly learn is that it's not quite that simple. The failures are
not told that building their business is most likely going to be a long and
slow process that's going to actually require some work. They are not told
that it is mandatory to develop and learn people and marketing skills. This is
the main reason successful people are successful. They have spent years
developing these important skills.  
  
Well,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), you may be wondering how does a person
without experience stand a chance to succeed in a home business. The truth is
that the people and marketing skills are still going to need to be developed
and learned. This will take time. Your best chance at success is probably to
partner with someone that is willing to work directly with you to build your
business while you develop and learn your people and marketing skills. This
person should be willing to train and mentor you and teach you how to succeed
in the industry.  
  
Before you get involved in any business opportunity,[burberry
outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), make shure you do your research to be
certain that the opportunity is legit and has a great track record and choose
what you feel that offers the greatest chance of success.  
  
If a person without experience can succeed in finding two key
ingredients,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), a mentor and business partner to work
with them and a business that they feel good about,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
then their chances of obtaining success goes up dramatically. Be patient and
never give up on your dreams. Be persistent and success will eventually
follow. Never forget your why and remember that success comes from being in
business for the long term.

How to Choose Eyeglasses for Women" )]

##  How to Choose Eyeglasses for Women

&lt;p&gt; Choosing a pair of eye glasses can be a major decision for many
women. Obviously, the proper prescription from your eye doctor is the most
important factor and the reason you're wearing eye glasses in the first place.
However, after the prescription is taken care of and you can see clearly,
several different factors come into play. It's no secret that eye glasses are
used as a fashion accessory by both sexes, but for women that connection may
be even stronger.  
  
Considering the circumstances that you'll be wearing the glasses in is one
factor for choosing the right pair. Many women pick out two or even three
different styles of frames for eye glasses, just to suit the different facets
of their lives. You may have a job in an office setting and run your kids
around to soccer practices or dance classes in the evenings,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
then hit the town with friends a couple times per month. In each situation,
you'll wear different clothes, shoes, and possibly a different purse. Wearing
different glasses to suit each circumstance helps to put the finishing touch
on the whole outfit. Once you've determined how many different styles of eye
glasses you may want,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), you can narrow it down further by
following a few specific guidelines.  
  
For a woman,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), matching a pair of eye glasses to your
skin tone is a good first step. You don't want to pick a pair of eyeglass
frames that stand out like a sore thumb on your face,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), but
you also don't want to pick frames that just blend in and aren't noticed at
all. This is where enlisting the help of your optician is a good idea. She can
suggest eye glasses that suit your skin tone the best,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), and will work best for each occasion.
The shape of your face is another big consideration when choosing eye glasses
for women.  
  
It's important to choose frames that balance the features of your
face,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), rather than accentuating one
particular feature. As an example, if your face is more of a square shape,
choosing square lenses might not make sense. If your face is long, you'd want
frames that work to shorten it up. Again, your optician will note the shape of
your face and make suggestions to create balance in the overall look.  
  
Once the look of the frames is right from an appearance and fashion
standpoint, it's time to tinker with the actual fit. Most pairs of eye glasses
can be adjusted for a comfortable fit if they don't fit the way you want. Your
optician will look carefully as the glasses are on your face to determine if
they are the proper width and sit on the spots they're supposed to sit. You
don't want eye glasses that squeeze your nose or temples, and you don't want
eye glasses that slide off your nose or are too wide. Since you're supposed to
be wearing them to correct your vision, comfort is a big factor for each pair
you buy.

budget.

The Bridesmaids Jewelry" )]

##  The Bridesmaids Jewelry

One of the most traditional bridesmaids gifts is jewelry. Choosing bridesmaids
jewelry depends on the style and color of the maids' dresses, and the theme of
the wedding.

If you are a bride and wondering what type of jewelry to pick for your
bridesmaids, consider classic pieces. You can never go wrong with a classic
jewelry as it is simple, yet elegant. It could be pearl, sterling silver,
crystal,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), or rhinestone jewelry. Usually,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), a
classic piece of jewelry complements formal dresses and traditional gowns.

Your bridesmaids can look at their best with a pair of classic
earrings,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), such as elegant drop style earrings, crystal;
silver; or pearl stud earrings,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), dangle ropes,
or small silver hoops. Select a moderate length of drop or dangle styled
earrings rather than selecting gaudy ones. Their moderate size will keep them
eye-catching and attractive while in their classic outfit.

If you are looking for another piece of classic jewelry for each of your
bridesmaids, consider simple pearl chokers, a nice strand of pearls, or simple
silver chains. These would make lovely accessories to accentuate the
bridesmaids' traditional attire. For charming alternatives, you may go for a
pearl, crystal or other charm necklaces. Remember that the neckline of the
bridesmaids' dresses is a major deciding factor when choosing bridesmaids
necklaces. For example, a short strand of pearls will look best for a
bridesmaid dress with a squared neckline.

Aside from necklaces and earrings, you might also want to give each of your
bridesmaids a matching bracelet. Bridesmaids bracelets come in a wide variety
of classic styles as well. If you want pieces that are pretty and have a
feminine touch, consider vine style bracelets. While charm bracelets with
their engraved names or initials can make a thoughtful keepsake for them.
Bracelets usually work well with sleeveless gowns and dresses, or outfits with
cap, short, or sheer sleeves. Just forgo the bracelets if your bridesmaids
will be wearing full sleeved dresses.

If your wedding is more of a modern style,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), you
might want to skip classic touches on your bridesmaids jewelry. You may
consider pretty pink coral earrings and necklaces, delicate anklets,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), or
chunky seashell bracelets if you are planning a beach wedding. For an outdoor
or garden wedding, consider jewelry pieces with floral designs, or pieces in
soft pastels or bright colors. Swarorvski jewelry is also a contemporary
option. Another alternative is a handmade jewelry that is individually
designed for each bridesmaid. Handmade pieces are something that your wedding
attendants can really treasure and cherish for years to come. They can also
make unique bridesmaids gifts that are truly made for your friends only.

You can find a much wider selection for bridesmaids jewelry and other bridal
jewelry online. Some of the most popular bridesmaids gifts these days are
engraved pieces. Usually, names, initials or a monogram are engraved on the
surface of the jewelry. Aside from these stunning items, you can also find
other more personalized bridesmaids gifts that are unique and sure to impress
your lovely wedding attendants.Related Theme Articles:

Viral Marketing Will Not Infect Your Computer" )]

##  Viral Marketing Will Not Infect Your Computer

&lt;p&gt; Viral Marketing has got nothing to do with viruses. It's also known
as viral advertising and is used to increase the profile of your product or
company by spreading your information by word of mouth.  
  
This can now be done via social media like facebook and twitter,[burberry
outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), or through forums and
email,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), because of the digital world we
live in.  
  
When a popular video is posted on YouTube,[burberry
outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), it's a very
good example of something being spread virally. because everybody passes along
to their friends before you know it,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), it's been seen by thousands of
people, and everyone is talking about it.  
  
It can be a very smart way to generate traffic but it shouldn't be your only
means of generating traffic. You're getting other people to spread the word
about your product, and from what they tell other people you get traffic back
to your website.  
  
One of the main reasons it is so effective is because it's very cheap to
setup. You only have to promote it once and then it gets spread like a virus -
it is passed onto a friend,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), they pass onto several others, they pass onto a
few others and so on.  
  
In order to have an effective viral marketing campaign there's a few things
that you need to do.  
  
Your product first of all needs to be easy to explain. It should be possible
to explain it in a few words - Imagine if it took 10 minutes when someone sat
and explained it to you. You wouldn't be interested in passing it on as you
would start to lose interest very quickly.  
  
It also has to be easy to use and this means it should be uncomplicated.
People will stop using it and not spread your message if it's at all
complicated. All someone needs to do is share the link with their friends and
then they share with their friends and then it spreads like wildfire, which is
another reason why videos spread virally on the Internet.  
  
Another thing a viral product needs is a coolness factor. People just won't
tell other people about it if they don't like using it or if youe product
isn't cool. How do you think iPhone's became so popular - a lot of their
popularity came from word-of-mouth. You'll find it's far easier to get people
to tell their friends about it,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), if your product is fun to use and this will make
your viral marketing campaign much more successful and effective.  
  
  
\------------------------------  
  
One of the best ways of spreading a product virally is by including something
clever or unexpected in it. It may make a user smile (there's the fun bit
again) making them want to pass it on to their friends. One of the most clever
examples I've seen of viral marketing can be found at this link:

Vers un encadrement des rémunérations, quelques pistes - L" )]

##  Vers un encadrement des rémunérations, quelques pistes - L

Les récents scandales autour des rémunérations des grands patrons ont mis en
évidence l'ampleur des avantages salariaux et des parachutes dorés dont ont
bénéficié certains dirigeants de grandes sociétés. Comment parvenir à un
meilleur contrôle des rémunérations ?&lt;p&gt;1\. Améliorer les principes du
gouvernement d'entreprise

Une voie possible est d'améliorer l'effectivité des principes du gouvernement
d'entreprise auxquels les rémunérations de toute nature doivent répondre.

Pour Yann Paclot, professeur de droit à l'université Paris-Sud et spécialiste
des questions de rémunérations, les pistes d'un meilleur contrôle des
rémunérations passent par "une plus grande indépendance des conseils
d'administration ou de surveillance vis-à-vis des dirigeants et un
renforcement des moyens accordés aux membres de ces conseils. Plus de moyens
d'investigation et de contrôle, mais aussi plus de moyens financiers,[burberry
outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), de manière à ce que les membres des
conseils puissent consacrer plus de temps à leur mandat". Selon lui,
l'indépendance des membres de ces organes est "essentielle, l'impartialité est
primordiale". Elle permettra également une plus grande transparence des
rémunérations.

Les limites

La proportion d'administrateurs indépendants  c'est-à-dire qui
n'entretiennent "aucune relation de quelque nature que ce soit avec la
société, son groupe ou sa direction" (définition de Daniel Bouton, PDG de la
Société générale) , selon le cabinet de conseil en recherche des dirigeants
Korn/Ferry International, augmente lentement, mais les pratiques en matière de
rémunérations restent encore largement fondées sur la "consanguinité", les
comités de rémunérations étant souvent réservés à une élite limitée, qui a
fait les mêmes grandes écoles, et qui cumule les mandats dans les conseils
d'administration des grandes sociétés. L'évolution sera donc lente.

Colette Neuville, présidente de l'Association de défense des actionnaires
minoritaires, souligne que "l'expérience montre que ces mesures ne sont pas
suffisantes pour éviter les scandales. C'est aux actionnaires de fixer les
principes de rémunération des dirigeants, pas aux administrateurs, même
indépendants, choisis par les PDG".

2\. Plafonner les rémunérations

Pour d'autres, il faudrait plafonner les rémunérations, ou tout au moins
réduire les écarts entre celles des patrons et celles des salariés de
l'entreprise. Pierre-Henri Leroy, président du cabinet de conseil Proxinvest,
recommande que la rémunération totale d'un patron du CAC 40 "ne puisse pas
être supérieure à 240 fois le smic, soit 100 fois la rémunération moyenne dans
les entreprises du CAC 40". "Cela fait tout de même 3,5 millions d'euros. On
vit bien avec cela ,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" )!", souligne-t-il. Dans l'esprit de
Pierre-Henri Leroy, cette somme comprendrait la valeur estimée des stock-
options et des actions gratuites attribuées pour l'année considérée, ce qui
diminuerait fortement les revenus des grands patrons.

Pierre Bilger, ancien patron d'Alstom, estime plutôt qu'"il faut faire en
sorte que l'on maintienne un écart raisonnable entre les rémunérations des PDG
et celles de leurs principaux collaborateurs". "Cet écart ne devrait pas
dépasser 50 %. Il est clair que si l'on s'orientait dans cette direction, la
plupart des scandales dont on parle n'auraient pas existé",[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
insiste-t-il.

Les limites

De telles mesures seraient populaires, mais il n'est pas certain qu'elles
pourraient être efficaces et surtout réalistes. D'abord, on peut remarquer que
le salaire cumulé des patrons du CAC 40 ne représente qu'un montant très
faible de la masse salariale. En 2005, le total des salaires versés aux PDG du
CAC 40 atteignait 95 millions d'euros, ce qui apparaît relativement faible par
rapport aux 85 milliards d'euros de bénéfices de ces sociétés. Répartir les
salaires des grands patrons n'aurait donc qu'un faible effet redistributif sur
les salariés de ces entreprises. D'autre part,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), il
est peu probable que l'on parvienne à limiter les rémunérations des grands
patrons,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), même si on le souhaitait. Dans une
économie libérale, cela paraît difficile. En effet, une solution autoritaire
pour fixer un niveau de rémunération se heurterait à la mobilité du capital
international et aux possibilités de délocalisation faciles pour les
multinationales. D'ailleurs, le versement des indemnités à M. Forgeard
pouvait-il être empêché ? Même si la législation française avait été stricte
en la matière, c'est loin d'être certain, car EADS est une société de droit
néerlandais, un droit très libéral en matière de rémunérations. Ce qui montre
que les dirigeants peuvent bénéficier des législations les plus avantageuses
en Europe. Dans ce contexte, aucun pays n'a pris de mesures pour limiter les
rémunérations des grands patrons ou interdire les parachutes dorés, conscient
de leur inutilité et de leur inefficacité.

3\. Mieux fixer les règles du jeu

Patrick Bonazza, rédacteur en chef du service Economie du magazine Le Point,
propose plusieurs solutions dans son ouvrage Les Goinfres. Enquête sur
l'argent des grands patrons français. Elles reprennent en partie les pistes
précédentes. Patrick Bonazza édicte plusieurs règles. Règle numéro un : ne pas
récompenser l'échec ; un patron qui a failli "ne doit pas toucher un kopeck".
Règle numéro deux : ne pas déconnecter les gains du PDG de ce qu'il fait
réellement pour l'entreprise ; ainsi faudrait-il supprimer les retraites
chapeaux. "Pourquoi l'entreprise devrait-elle payer pour quelqu'un qui ne lui
apporte plus rien ?", s'interroge Patrick Bonazza. Règle numéro trois : jouer
la clarté. "Maintenir le flou dans les rémunérations est un sport qui fait des
ravages dans les états-majors." Ainsi,"le bonus de Zacharias [ancien PDG de
Vinci] dépendait d'un nombre invraisemblable de critères". Il faut revenir à
des critères d'établissement des rémunérations plus précis et moins nombreux.
Enfin, autre règle proposée : éviter de surpayer le succès d'un grand patron.

Les limites

Ces pistes sont intéressantes. Mais elles s'opposent aux intérêts des grands
patrons et aussi des administrateurs qui déterminent ou adoptent les
rémunérations des grands patrons la plupart du temps sans discussion, tant les
liens sont forts et tant ils forment une élite qui s'autorégule.

La loi,[burberry outlet online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), comme on l'a vu récemment, peut
accélérer les choses en favorisant, par exemple, une plus grande objectivité
des critères de rémunération ; elle ne pourra pas imposer un plafond de
salaire sans effet contre-productif au détriment de l'économie française.

Who Can You Partner With" )]

##  Who Can You Partner With

Who Can You Partner With to do a joint venture or earn affiliate commissions?  
  
Do you have friends or peers that do regular promotions with complimentary
businesses or maybe they earn additional income by referring certain companies
or products?  
  
This is what I'm referring to here.  
  
First, if you're thinking "but I can't do that with my business" or some other
negative thought is crossing your mind - GET RID OF IT! Every single person
(not even business owner) can make money some how this way.  
  
On the other hand, if you're saying "I already do this", well then GREAT!
But...I'll bet you aren't doing as much as you could be doing, right? And
that's probably due to lack of time right?  
  
So, I challenge you this week to take 2 steps:  
1\. Make a list like the one I did below for myself as to all the people you
could potentially outsource to,[burberry
outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), refer business to and also those who
it would make sense that they referred back to you. Only list the obvious-type
partners, not random businesses that you want; they need to have a similar
target market as you do for this to work and be a true WIN-WIN situation.  
2\. Take this list of industries,[burberry
outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), types of companies, etc. and then go
into your database first to see who YOU know that fits these categories. After
that, go to your membership organizations, etc. and look for others in your
local area and then online too. Build a big 'prospect list' so to speak of
everyone you would love to collaborate with and then start calling them and
emailing them asking them to chat about the opportunities available to you
both.  
The more you do this,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), the more opportunities will open up to you,
you'll see. But make sure you're intention is to make it a WIN-WIN or it won't
work ok?  
  
Here is a list of other industries you might want to check into as joint
venture opportunities for your company.

Factbox  AIG's Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life" )]

##  Factbox AIG's Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - American International Group Inc has accepted a
$2.16 billion offer for its Taiwan Nan Shan Life unit from a group led by
local conglomerate Ruentex Group.,[louis
vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" )

Following are some facts about Nan Shan:

\-- Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
behind the life insurance units of financial holding firms Cathay Financial
and Fubon Financial.

\-- Founded in 1963, Nan Shan has 4 million policy holders,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), or about one-
sixth of Taiwan's 23 million population. Its assets were T$1.7 trillion ($53
billion) as of June 2010.

\-- Nan Shan lost T$12.5 billion in the third quarter of last year and T$12.7
billion in the second. For the full year of 2009,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), the firm
reported a net profit of T$10.6 billion.

\-- Nan Shan has about 30,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),000 sales agents, one of the largest
numbers in the local insurance industry. The huge sales force had become a
burden for AIG,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), in part because of union demands that all
the different types of employee pensions were protected.

\-- AIG put Nan Shan up for sale in 2009 as part of efforts to raise cash and
repay the U.S. government for its bailout.

\-- Taiwan's regulators rejected an original bid by Hong Kong-listed battery
maker China Strategic and Hong Kong investment firm Primus because the two did
not meet criteria on experience in the insurance business and ability to raise
funds for future operations.

\-- That deal had sparked protests from politicians and unions over the buyer
group's political connections with mainland China and over fears jobs would be
cut.

Snap Analysis  The long arm of the U.S. healthcare ruling" )]

##  Snap Analysis The long arm of the U.S. healthcare ruling

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court ruling to uphold the core of
President Barack Obama's 2010 healthcare law on Thursday has wide-ranging
political and economic implications.

Here is a snap analysis of what it means for Americans, healthcare providers,
insurers, the law and the presidential campaign.

How does the ruling affect the average American?

* Working families with annual household incomes up to nearly $90,000 will be able to purchase private insurance through new state insurance markets at prices subsidized according to income level,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), beginning in 2014. But people with household incomes of around $29,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),000, who qualify for coverage under the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor, may have to wait for their respective state governments to decide whether they will join the program's huge expansion. Preventive healthcare measures including mammograms and other cancer screenings will be available without deductibles or co-pays. Adult children up to age 26 can remain on their parents' health insurance plans. Senior citizens can expect to continue receiving discounts on prescription drugs aimed at closing the Medicare coverage gap known as the "doughnut hole." Health insurers will continue to pay rebates on premiums not sufficiently targeted at healthcare services. Beginning in 2014,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage to adults with pre-existing medical conditions and would be required to stop or curb discriminatory pricing based on gender, age and health status.

What about healthcare providers?

* The ruling removes one cloud of uncertainty over the future of healthcare reform and would help the administration's efforts to implement it fully by January 1,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), 2014, when the law is scheduled to go into effect. Under the decision, physicians and hospitals continue to move away from the traditional fee-for-service healthcare business model and toward more efficient systems that coordinate care. For healthcare providers, the affirmation represents millions of potential new patients, either through private plans or the government's Medicaid program for the poor. Some, however, would be under added pressure to enact more savings, which could cut into revenues. The administration still faces some fairly tall hurdles, such as establishing regulated health insurance markets in all 50 states so consumers can purchase subsidized coverage. Up until now,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), over a dozen states have done little or nothing to create such exchanges, partly because of the uncertainty over the fate of the law. Down the road, if Republicans succeed in taking control of the White House and the Senate in November (they already control the House of Representatives), they would likely try to repeal the law in 2013.

Where does the ruling leave health insurers?

* The health insurance industry can expect premium revenue from millions of new, healthy customers through state exchanges. But the industry will also have to operate with new consumer protections that require coverage access for people with pre-existing medical conditions and other health status issues, and mandate preventive care without customary charges.

How might the ruling influence the presidential campaign?

* This is a big victory for Obama, who has weathered years of criticism from conservatives about his reforms. The decision could energize the president and his supporters,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), while undercutting presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who introduced similar reforms as Massachusetts governor but opposes their use as national policy. But there could be a silver lining for Republicans: the opinion could light a fire under party candidates and constituents who want a president who would repeal the law in 2013.

PetroChina pays $5.4 billion for Canadian gas assets" )]

##  PetroChina pays $5.4 billion for Canadian gas assets

CALGARY, Alberta/HONG KONG (Reuters) - PetroChina is purchasing half of a
prolific shale gas project from Canada's Encana Corp for C$5.4 billion ($5.4
billion), marking the largest Chinese investment yet in a foreign natural gas
asset.

Chinese companies such as PetroChina and CNOOC have been scouring globally for
unconventional gas assets to reduce reliance on coal and satisfy its energy
hunger to fuel its economy, now the world's second-largest.

In January,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com
"http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ), CNOOC struck a $570 million shale deal
with U.S. natural gas company Chesapeake Energy Corp, its second such deal
with the American company in about four months.

On Thursday, shares of PetroChina, Asia's largest oil and gas producer, fell
more than 2 percent in Hong Kong trade, lagging the Hang Seng's 0.7 percent
fall, as analysts said the deal, to be paid all in cash, was pricey. Encana
shares closed down 60 Canadian cents, or 2 percent, at C$30.65 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. It announced the deal after the market closed.

"Not too dissimilar to the CNOOC/Chesapeake deals, the PetroChina/Encana tie-
up is another win-win that enables China to acquire quick exposure to the long
term shale oil/gas boom in North America," said Gordon Kwan, an analyst with
Mirae Asset Management in Hong Kong.

Kwan said the deal will also allow Chinese companies like PetroChina to
migrate the technology back to China for its development in domestic
unconventional oil and gas resources.

LITTLE THREAT FROM POLITICS

Encana,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), one of the North America's
largest gas producers,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), and state-owned PetroChina agreed to form a
50-50 joint venture to develop the Cutbank Ridge lands in the westernmost
province of British Columbia over several years.

The deal, which is subject to approval by the Canadian and Chinese
governments,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), came after nine months of talks,[burberry
outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), both companies
said.

The venture will allow Encana to accelerate development of its vast reserves
while keeping a lid on capital investments at a time when natural gas markets
are weak. For the Chinese, it's another step toward the country's goal of
tripling the use of the lower-carbon fuel over the next decade.

The venture is likely to go ahead without much political fanfare as the
purchase of a 50 percent stake in the Canadian firm's unconventional gas
assets was not nearly as threatening as an outright acquisition.

"You can't guarantee it is going to go ahead but I think it is quite likely.
These guys are more than happy to take a few billion dollars in there, that is
ultimately what it is all about," said Brynjar Bustnes, analyst at JP Morgan
in Hong Kong.

The value of the deal surpasses PetroChina's $3.1 billion joint bid with Royal
Dutch Shell to buy Australia's coal-seam gas player Arrow Energy last year.

It is also worth more than the largest previous Canadian energy buy, Sinopec
Corp's $4.65 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' stake in the Syncrude
Canada oil sands venture.

"It looks expensive to us," said Neil Beveridge, analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein in Hong Kong.

"If you look at the proven reserves that PetroChina are getting it is one
trillion cubic feet of gas for $5.4 billion, so it looks to be about $5.40 per
mscf (million cubic feet) on the current proven reserves which looks to be
expensive."

The deal has been so priced even as North American gas prices are languishing
under the weight of high inventories and the potential production that new
technology has opened up in hard-to-reach shale formations.

The price tag represents 3.8 percent of Encana's 2010 estimated production for
24 percent of its market capitalization.

"This is an outstanding valuation for Encana," CIBC World Markets analyst

Instant view  Azumi to be Japan finance minister" )]

##  Instant view Azumi to be Japan finance minister

TOKYO (Reuters) - Jun Azumi, a former parliamentary affairs chief for the
ruling Democratic Party, will become Japan's new finance minister, local media
reported, after new Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's first choice for the job
reportedly turned it down.

Azumi will take charge of Japan's currency and fiscal policies at a time when
the world's third-biggest economy grapples with the yen's sharp appreciation
and a public debt twice the size of its $5 trillion economy.

KEY POINTS

\-- The lineup of the new cabinet is expected to be announced on Friday by
Yoshihiko Noda, 54,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), who was voted in by parliament
as prime minister this week,[burberry outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), becoming the nation's sixth leader in five
years.

\-- Noda, himself finance minister from June 2010 in the previous
administration, backed a government proposal to double the 5 percent sales tax
by the middle of the decade to fund bulging social security costs and curb
massive public debt.

\-- Katsuya Okada, a fiscal hawk who held the party's No.2 post, turned down
Noda's request to take over the crucial financial portfolio,[burberry
outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), public
broadcaster NHK reported earlier.

COMMENTARY

AYAKO SERA,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), MARKET ECONOMIST, SUMITOMO TRUST
AND BANKING, TOKYO

"He (Azumi) has not made many comments about intervention or fiscal policies
so his basic policy stance is not clear.

The key would be how well he could manage and work with the bureaucrats
because of the friction the party has created with bureaucrats. Azumi has
appeared on media and leaves an impression as a very intelligent person, so
there is a risk that he might pursue his own path without sufficiently
consulting others."

JESPER KOLL, DIRECTOR OF EQUITIES RESEARCH AT JPMORGAN, TOKYO

"Noda's strong hold is the finance ministry. Assuming he is going to leverage
that, no politician wants the job because fiscal, budget and tax policy are
going to be led by the prime minister. Whomever Noda nominates,[burberry
outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), the finance
minister will likely be a 'yes-man' for Mr Noda."

BACKGROUND

\-- Noda has said Japan will need to raise taxes temporarily to help pay for
rebuilding from the devastating March 11 tsunami. But he has grown more
cautious about the timing of any rises,[burberry
outlet](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), saying economic
growth and fiscal reform are both vital.

\-- Noda has promised firm steps including intervention against excessive and
rapid currency moves and wants to work closely with the Bank of Japan.

\-- The new administration will have to cope with a resurgent yen that
threatens exports, forge a new energy policy while ending the worst nuclear
crisis since Chernobyl.

\-- The Democrats swept to power two years ago promising to change how Japan
is ruled. But the party quickly lost momentum, dogged by internal divisions
and a hung parliament as its novice team confronted the global financial
crisis. The March disaster left 20,000 dead or missing and has pushed the
economy back into recession.

\-- Moody's Investors Service cut Japan's sovereign credit rating on August 24
citing a buildup of public debt and a lack of leadership and a long-term
strategy to cope with its fiscal challenges.

Japan's Hoya to sell Pentax camera business to Ricoh" )]

##  Japan's Hoya to sell Pentax camera business to Ricoh

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese optical glass-maker Hoya said on Friday it would
sell its Pentax camera business to copier and printer maker Ricoh,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), in
a deal the Nikkei business daily said was worth about 10 billion yen ($124.2
million).

Battling falling prices for its compact cameras, Ricoh hopes to establish a
presence in the profitable upmarket single-lens reflex camera
segment,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), the Nikkei business daily said.

The two companies will hold a news conference about the transaction at 0730
GMT.

The deal will go through in October,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
Hoya said in a filing to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Shares in Hoya ended up 4 percent at 1,[louis
vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ),845
yen, after climbing as high as 6 percent to 1,888 yen on the news, while Ricoh
was down 0.2 percent,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), in a broader market climb of 0.5 percent.

Hoya, which bought Pentax in 2007 mainly to gain access to its medical
technology, had been widely expected to sell off the camera business.

Pentax is the world's tenth largest digital camera brand by shipments, with
just 1.5 percent of the market, according to research firm IDC.

Sales of Pentax cameras dropped just over 13 percent in the year ended March
2011,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), amid fierce price competition in the
compact camera market.

Copier and printer-maker Ricoh, which aims to shed nearly 10 percent of its
workforce to improve profits, also has a digital camera business, but sales
are too small to feature in global data.

Instant view  July core producer prices accelerate" )]

##  Instant view July core producer prices accelerate

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. core producer prices rose at their fastest pace in
six months in July, pushed up by higher tobacco and light truck costs,
according to a government report on Wednesday that could stoke inflation
fears.

COMMENTS:

MICHAEL GAPEN, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK

"It was above expectations. It was an upside surprise. We were looking for a
drop off in the energy component. We had expected that to be offset by higher
food prices and light vehicle prices.

"This continues to show pipeline pressure across many consumer goods. We have
seen these pressures for some time. We have seen these reports several times
before when they are stronger than forecast. We have seen some pass-throughs,
but given the state of the economy and lack of pricing power by the corporate
sector,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), we haven't seen a full pass-through.
Margins will likely be pressured among firms, which could affect earnings
growth."

BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK

"The only way we can be only modestly confident about this is if it shows up
tomorrow in the CPI. The big question is do producers have the power to pass
on prices to consumers, and I think that's doubtful. There's so much liquidity
sloshing around so there's a bit of upward pressure on wholesale prices, but
in the grander scheme of things, inflation remains a very distant problem for
the Fed. I think the Fed even desires a bit of inflation."

EUGENIO ALEMAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO, CHARLOTTE,[burberry
outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), NC

"It was a little bit stronger than expected but it comes from a very deep drop
in the previous month. There was a revision on the numbers that might have
also affected the seasonally adjusted numbers. The story is that prices are
increasing, which is good in the sense that this is what the Federal Reserve
wants.

(HOW IT AFFECTS CHANCES OF QE3)

"It's too difficult to know. there is a strong opposition within the Federal
Reserve to approve a QE3 now. They are in a very difficult position because
they have been trying to reinflate the economy. The economy is inflating but
growth is not happening. We could be at the doors of another stagflation -- no
growth and inflation."

IAN LYNGEN, SENIOR GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGIST,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), CRT
CAPITAL GROUP,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com
"http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ), STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT

"Overall, the PPI release challenges the Fed's notion that inflation pressures
are moderating, although we'll stress that today's release will not likely
change the market's expectations for tomorrow's more policy relevant CPI
release.

"As expected, the Treasury market is not taking much direction from the
release, trading down slightly immediately following the release, but has
returned to pre-release levels -- off modestly from yesterday's closes."

DAVID SLOAN,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF
THOMSON REUTERS

"It is possible to identify special factors that pushed the core rate above
trend,[burberry outlet](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/
"http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/" ), and there are good reasons to
expect inflationary pressures to fade in the months ahead. However, with the
core PPI still in a clear underlying uptrend, the strength of this number
cannot be fully dismissed. Growth risks may lie on the downside, but it is
less clear that price risks also do."

Newfound optimism could extend to earnings season" )]

##  Newfound optimism could extend to earnings season

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stock market is riding a wave of renewed optimism and
investors looking for a reason other than Europe to keep buying may find it in
earnings.

The European debt crisis and worries about U.S. growth pressured the market
greatly in recent months. Since hitting 13-month lows last week, though,
stocks have rallied sharply, putting bullish investors back in the driver's
seat as shorts scramble to cover big bets.

This feel good mood may not be over.

The market's lousy psychology for most of the past two months -- built on
expectations for poor economic growth and a worsening euro-zone crisis --
could mean investors are still expecting disappointments. Such cautious
expectations might end up helping stocks if results are not dismal.

"I think the worst-case scenario has already been built into these stocks
because of Europe,[burberry outlet online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" )," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment
strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
Vermont.

The earnings period is due to kick off on Tuesday, when Alcoa is due to report
after the market's close. Google and JPMorgan Chase are expected to report on
Thursday.

Analysts' forecasts for S&amp;P 500 companies' profits have come down slightly
in recent weeks. They expect a rise in profits of 12.6 percent compared with
the third quarter a year ago. On July 1 their forecast was for 17 percent
growth, Thomson Reuters data showed.

Given the big losses stocks have seen recently, gains could actually be in
store for the market, some analysts argue. The benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index is down roughly 10 percent since the beginning of the third quarter.

"We're of the belief that when we get some news out, the market's reaction is
probably going to be positive just due to the fact that we've clearly priced
in a lot of pessimism," said Thomas Villalta, portfolio manager for Jones
Villalta Asset Management in Austin, Texas.

VALUATIONS STILL COMPELLING

Investors have worried that the European debt and U.S. growth problems, as
well as possibly less-robust expansion in China, hurt third-quarter results.
With recent U.S. economic data coming in better than expected,[burberry
outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), it has given investors hope that
company results will be strong enough to bolster stock prices.

Unlike the euro-zone crisis, a vast problem that causes investors to respond
mostly at an emotional level, earnings reports allow for direct comparisons to
current market valuations. And by many measures, stocks are relatively cheap.

The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P, that is, a measure of the price
paid for a share relative to the company's profit,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), is
low by historical standards. The S&amp;P 500's forward P/E of 10.8 is at its
lowest in roughly 10 years.

"Even if the earnings deteriorate somewhat, you're still in a good area," said
Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Howard Silverblatt.

The third quarter is still on track to be the second-highest earnings period,
in dollar terms, on record after the second quarter,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),
Silverblatt said.

Thomson Reuters estimates third-quarter earnings will total $230 billion.

Sectors expected to see the biggest growth are energy and materials,[louis
vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ),
with gold repeatedly hitting records in recent months and oil at historically
high levels, Thomson Reuters data showed.

"There's a lot of a cushion already built into the average stock to compensate
for a variance in earnings plus or minus," said Mendelsohn.

Mike Jackson, founder of Denver-based investment firm T3 Equity Labs, sees a
high probability of an earnings upside surprise this reporting period.

In terms of sectors, he puts industrials on top in terms of the potential for
an upside earnings surprise, followed by utilities, financials, consumer
staples and information technology.

"You've got the true driver of the market (earnings) continuing to go forward
and the market going south. That's unusual," he said. "There's a fairly good
chance of surprise at the index level and at the sector level."

Greek bond swap falling short, governments may fill gap  sou" )]

##  Greek bond swap falling short, governments may fill gap sou

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Talks about private sector creditors paying for part of
a second Greek bailout are going badly, senior European bankers said on
Wednesday, raising the prospect that euro zone governments will have to
increase their contribution to the aid package.

"Governments are mulling an increase of their share of the burden,[burberry
outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ),"
said one of the bankers,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), who is familiar with the talks.

An IMF source told Reuters if the deal with private bondholders does not help
reduce Greece's debt, then Europeans would have to provide more financing for
the next rescue package or the IMF may be unwilling to commit more money for
Athens.

Banks and investment funds have been negotiating with Athens for months on a
bond swap scheme to cut Greece's debt burden from 160 percent of the nation's
annual output to a more manageable 120 percent by 2020. This is central to a
second, 130 billion euro ($165 billion) bailout that international lenders
have drawn up to help the country avert default.

As part of these talks, banks have agreed to a "voluntary" 50 percent write-
down on Greek debt holdings but have faced demands to make further
concessions, a factor that has made it less attractive for some of the
investors to take part on a voluntary basis.

The participation rate among private sector investors is currently less than
75 percent, which means Greece's debt will be reduced by far less than
expected, the source said.

Asked whether governments will have to put up more cash to make up for such a
shortfall, another senior banker said: "Nothing is decided yet, but the bigger
the imposed haircut,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com
"http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ), the less appetite there is for voluntary
conversion."

A third senior banker, who was asked the same question, said: "Private sector
involvement is going badly."

There are suggestions in euro zone government circles that ministers are
realizing they may need to bolster the planned second bailout if the voluntary
bond swap scheme falls short of expectations.

Stumping up yet more money would be politically difficult in Germany and other
countries in the northern part of the currency bloc.

An Athens-based source close to the talks on private sector involvement (PSI)
insisted: "The government is pushing hard and is close to signing a deal." But
the source declined to give an indication about take-up.

German newspaper Handelsblatt said in a preview of a story to be published on
Thursday that according to IMF calculations, there was a hole in the
"significant tens of billions" in the Greek aid package that would have to be
plugged.

MERKEL,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), SARKOZY INSIST

On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy insisted private-sector bondholders must share in reducing Greece's
debt burden and said no further aid would flow to Athens without a deal.

Banks and other private sector creditors attempted to agree a deal before
Christmas to cut the value of their bonds by half in return for a mix of cash
and new bonds.

But the talks hit trouble over the details of the debt swap such as the
coupon, maturity and the credit guarantees. These will determine the bonds'
Net Present Value (NPV),[burberry outlet
online](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/
"http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/" ), and thereby the actual hit the banks
need to take.

Policymakers insist agreement is near despite weeks of talks already. EU
Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Tuesday
negotiators were "about to finalise shortly".

Athens needs to conclude the deal and secure funding from its euro zone
partners and the International Monetary Fund to be able to redeem 14.5 billion
euros of maturing bonds on March 20. [ID:nL6E8CA3I3]. A deal needs to come
well before that, because the paperwork alone takes at least six weeks.

Hedge funds who have picked up Greek debt are intent on staying out of the
bond swap deal, sources say. They either prefer letting the country go under,
which would trigger the credit insurance they have bought, or hope to get paid
out in full if enough others sign up.

But Athens could change its laws and impose Collective Action Clauses which
would force all creditors to sign up to the bond swap if a clear majority had
voluntarily done so.

Charles Dallara, the head of a group representing private-sector banks, will
hold talks in Athens on Thursday with Greek government officials on a
voluntary swap of privately held Greek bonds, a spokesman for Dallara's
Institute of International Finance said.

According to a weekend report in German magazine Der Spiegel, the IMF believes
Greece will still be sinking under the burden of its debts even after a bond
swap deal is struck, and that further measures may need to be taken if the
country is to avoid default.

##  Moody's keeps negative outlook on Japan, watching developmen

TOKYO (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service is maintaining a negative outlook
on Japan's sovereign debt rating and watching developments,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), its senior
vice-president Tom Byrne said on Wednesday.

Byrne made the remarks after S&amp;P lowered the outlook for Japan's sovereign
rating to negative on Wednesday,[burberry outlet
online](http://www.bags2013.net/ "http://www.bags2013.net/" ), saying the
earthquake,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" ), tsunami and nuclear power plant disaster
will increase Japan's fiscal deficits above previous estimates.

"The bottom line is we are maintaining a negative outlook and watching
developments,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/
"http://www.outletbags2012.com/" )," Byrne told Reuters in an interview. "We
are interested in the bottom line,[louis
vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com" ),
that's the rating bottom line -- the government fiscal deficit and government
debt."

Moody's warned in February it might cut Japan's Aa2 rating -- its third
highest -- if government policies fall short of comprehensive tax reform.

Byrne said the most immediate concern has not changed since then, which is to
see if the government can come up with comprehensive programs in June to bring
huge public debt under control in a fast-aging society.

Japan's debt trajectory has been bumped upwards and its deficit will be
greater in fiscal 2011/12 than the government had anticipated in the wake of
the March 11 earthquake, Byrne said.

But it was not great enough to prompt any immediate negative rating
action,[burberry outlet online](http://www.bags2013.net/
"http://www.bags2013.net/" ), he said.

Byrne expects the government to use a combination of a shift in spending cuts
and tax rises to fund the cost of reconstruction.

"The bottom line is what the government deficit will be and how that will
contribute to government debt."

Lots of networkers have a giant puzzle they can't solve - and that is
advertising their MLM business. The problem arises from two main factors.
First, there is tough competition nowadays in the network marketing arena.
When you advertise in any of the industry magazines,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), or in one of the major search
engines like Google and Yahoo,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), you will notice that the market is already
bombarded with similar marketing messages. How on earth can a network
marketing professional get noticed in this sea of competitive advertisers who
also want to promote their respective business opportunities?  
  
The second conflict arises from the budget required for advertising your
networking business. Because of the tough competition mentioned above, there
is a natural increase in ad rates. Buying full page ad positions in popular
network marketing magazines is no longer as affordable as before. And Google
pay-per-click rates have outrageously risen to almost insurmountable rates
that only the "top players" can afford to maneuver their way through it.
Unless you have a definite plan that works towards helping you get a decent
return on your investment,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), you will lose big money.  
  
So how can an MLM winner and high flyer like you solve the problems we
discussed above? I have developed a simple promotional system for myself, and
I've used it to bring hundreds of people to my downline in the past two years.
The key is to minimize (and even erase) your advertising costs by front-end
selling. The way to do this is to first sell an affordable (almost no cost)
info product that caters specifically to the needs of youre target crowd,
without having to bombard them with details of your multilevel program.  
  
The cheap product must contain some information that is extremely useful to
your target audience, must help their current needs,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), and make them want to come back for more. The money generated by cheap
product sales can then be reinvested back into advertising purposes. This will
initiate a continuous flow of cash and activity in your MLM biz. Plus, you'll
generate many business leads in the process so you can later show them your
opportunity.  
  
I call this process the "backdoor cashflow mechanism" because it doesn't
pressure people to join a business opportunity. Alternatively, you gain
competitive advantage by genuinely helping prospects get more information as
such as affordable value. The moment they buy from you,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), rapport is built, and the likelihood of a long term business relationship
goes up. For more information about this method,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com

techniques that has personally worked for me.

##  Economic growth gauge falls to six-week low ECRI

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A measure of future U.S. economic growth fell to
a six-week low in the latest week,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), while the index's annualized growth
rate rose to an 18-week high,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), a research group said on Friday.

The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent
forecasting group,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), said its Weekly Leading Index fell to 122.1 in the
week ended October 15 from 122.2 the previous week.

That was the lowest since September 3, when it stood at 121.9.

The index's annualized growth rate rose to minus 6.8 percent from minus 7.0
percent a week earlier. That was the highest since June 11,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), when it stood at minus 6.1 percent.

Occasionally the index level and growth rate can move in different
directions,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), because the growth rate is derived from
a four-week moving average,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), the research institute said.

Chronology  Federal Reserve's transparency steps" )]

##  Chronology Federal Reserve's transparency steps

n"&gt;(Reuters) - The Federal Reserve this week will begin publishing
forecasts for short-term U.S. interest rates and the expected timing of its
next rate hike.,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )

The forecasts, to be released at the close of the Fed's policy-setting panel's
meeting on Wednesday,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), are seen as a significant step
toward greater transparency. The U.S. central bank may also move to set a
formal inflation target.

The following are some of the other main strides the Fed has taken toward
greater openness since 1994:

February 1994 - The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) begins
to release statements announcing moves in the overnight federal funds
rate,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), its main policy tool.

February 1995 - The FOMC decides to issue "lightly edited" verbatim
transcripts of deliberations with a five-year lag.

August 1997 - The Fed publicly acknowledges policy is formulated in terms of a
target for the federal funds rate. The FOMC begins to put a number on the
intended federal funds rate in its policy-implementing directive to the New
York Fed.

December 1998 - The FOMC adopts a policy of immediately communicating a major
change in its views on the likely direction of monetary policy. The first
announced bias shift was in May 1999. It has issued a statement after every
meeting since then,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), whether or not it has changed rates or
shifted its bias.

December 1999 - The FOMC adopts a new procedure on issuing assessments of
balance of economic risks, instead of policy bias. The statement issued after
the February 2000 FOMC meeting was the first with the new balance of risks
language.

March 2002 - The FOMC adopts policy of immediately announcing whether there
were any dissenting votes. Previously the roll-call vote was disclosed only
when the meeting's minutes were released.

July 2004 - The Fed begins to provide a forecast for core inflation,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), in addition to overall
inflation,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), in its semiannual monetary policy
reports to Congress. Fed officials generally focus more heavily on core
inflation measures.

December 2004 - The FOMC decides to accelerate the release of its meetings'
minutes by making them public three weeks after each gathering as opposed to
after the subsequent meeting, a lag of about six weeks.

February 2005 - The Fed provides two-year forecasts from policymakers in its
February monetary policy report to Congress. Previously, the February report
contained only forecasts for the current year.

November 2007 - The Fed says it will increase the frequency of its forecasts
to four times a year from two, and extend the horizon of projections to three
years from two.

February 2009 - The FOMC adds longer-run projections for GDP, unemployment and
inflation to its three-year quarter forecasts. The move is seen as effectively
establishing an informal inflation target.

December 2010 - As required by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the Fed
releases the names of firms that borrowed from its special emergency programs
during the financial crisis. The law did not require the release of details of
past lending from its regular "discount window," although future lending will
be disclosed with a two-year lag.

March 2011 - The Fed releases the names of banks that borrowed from its
discount window during the financial crisis after having run out of legal
appeals to block publication.

April 2011 - Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds the Fed's first-ever post-meeting
news conference.

Timeline  Spain's banking crisis" )]

##  Timeline Spain's banking crisis

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's banks are suffering a hangover from the effects of
a near-decade building boom that ended in 2008 leaving lenders saddled with
around 300 billion euros ($374 billion) in loans to housebuilders, equivalent
to nearly one third of the country's gross domestic product.

Two recessions in three years and the highest unemployment rate amongst
developed nations has compounded banks' problems, increasing the likelihood of
defaults on mortgage payments and business loans.

Here are some key developments in Spain's long-running bank crisis.

March 2009 - Government takes over mid-sized savings bank CCM, which had a
capital shortfall and was heavily exposed to loans to the property sector.

June 2009 - Spain aims to cut the number of unlisted regional savings banks,
or cajas, originating from institutions set up hundreds of years ago to help
farmers at times of poor harvest.

The state-backed bank restructuring fund, the FROB, is created,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), giving loans to help the 45 cajas
merge with each other and reduce their number to around 15 to eliminate excess
capacity in the banking system and make them more efficient.

May 2010 - The FROB takes control of Cajasur, a savings bank run by the
Catholic Church, with troubled property loans.

February 2011 - The government demands banks get private capital on board via
stock listings or equity investment to reinforce financial safety nets. Many
private equity firms come to Spain in following months,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), but none end up investing.

The FROB is given extra powers and will directly inject cash into those
lenders that do not manage to get private funds to raise their capital ratios
up to minimum levels. As of June 2012, FROB has spent 15 billion euros to
rescue banks without taking into account the biggest problem lender, Bankia.

July 2011 - FROB takes over CAM savings bank, which the head of the central
bank later calls the "worst of the worst." The central bank found not only
enormous losses at CAM, but the bank's directors awarded themselves
multimillion euro severance pay packages that generated public rage.

July 2011 - Bankia, the result of a merger between heavyweight Caja Madrid and
six smaller savings banks, lists on the Spanish stock exchange in an operation
heavily dependent on retail investors and at a deeply discounted price.

Sep. 2011 - FROB takes over three savings banks -- NovaCaixaGalicia, Catalunya
Caixa and Unnim -- valuing the lenders at practically zero.

November 2011 - FROB takes over Banco de Valencia.

February 2012 - The new conservative government forces banks to write off 50
billion euros of losses on repossessed property assets and loans to property
developers that have fallen in arrears.

April 25 - Spain's largest banks are sufficiently capitalized to withstand a
decline in economic conditions, says the International Monetary Fund, but it
pinpoints a group of 10 banks, including Bankia,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), that are vulnerable.

May 2012 - The government increases provisioning demands on banks,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), asking them to write off an
additional 30 billion euros on performing loans to housebuilders.

May 9 - Spain takes over Bankia by converting a 4.5 billion euro state loan
into equity. As of June 8, investors in Bankia, many of them retail customers
at the bank,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html
"http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), had lost 70 percent of
their investment.

May 23 - Spain says the rescue of Bankia will cost at least 9 billion euros.

May 25 - Bankia asks government for 19 billion euro in state rescue,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), which added to the 4.5 billion euros in convertible bonds, brings the total
cost up to 23.5 billion euros.

June 1 - Bank of Spain data shows capital is flying out of Spain --mostly on
the wholesale market -- due to fears on the stability of the euro zone's
fourth largest economy with 66.2 billion euros of funds leaving the country in
March against a surplus for the same month last year.

June 6 - Spain's public prosecutor opens an anti-corruption investigation into
Bankia. ($1 = 0.8021 euros)

Le cuivre joue en sourdine - LeMonde.fr" )]

##  Le cuivre joue en sourdine - LeMonde.fr

Depuis quatre mois, le cuivre est à la baisse. Oublié le pic des 8 800 dollars
(6 782 euros), la tonne atteint le 11 mai 2006 ,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" )!

Depuis le début de l'année 2007, le métal rouge est revenu entre 5 000 et 6
000 dollars,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), au gré des grèves dans les mines
chiliennes. Jouant désormais en sourdine, il a atteint à Londres, vendredi 2
février, le cours de 5 600 dollars, en chute de 40 % par rapport aux folies de
2006.

" Le déclencheur de la baisse a été le gonflement des stocks, explique Franz
Wenzel, directeur adjoint de la stratégie chez AXA Investment Managers. Ceux-
ci ont pratiquement doublé en 2006. Bien qu'ils restent à un niveau
historiquement bas, cette hausse confirme les analystes dans leur attente d'un
ralentissement du cycle économique."

Car le cuivre est considéré par les spécialistes comme un bon baromètre de la
météo industrielle mondiale. Il est le métal manufacturier par excellence qui
entre dans la fabrication des tuyaux,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), des câbles, des semi-conducteurs
et même des médicaments.

Or, on constate que la surproduction guette les semi-conducteurs et que le
secteur de la construction, grande consommatrice de cuivre, a ralenti aux
Etats-Unis comme ailleurs.

Du côté de l'offre,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), la
pénurie ne menace plus. L'International Copper Study Group (ICSG) estime que
la production africaine a augmenté de 16 % au cours des dix premiers mois de
2006 par rapport à la même période de 2005, grâce à la mise en exploitation de
mines dans le bassin du Congo et en Zambie.

Par conséquent, l'excédent de l'offre sur la demande s'est élevé à 213 000
tonnes, contre un déficit de 298 000,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), un an plus tôt.

M. Wenzel estime que le prix du cuivre ne devrait plus baisser au même rythme
et que la volatilité de son cours sera moindre que par le passé : les capitaux
spéculatifs excédentaires se sont retirés de son marché à la fin de l'année
2006.

Comme l'économie chinoise ne ralentit guère, que l'américaine semble avoir
surmonté ses doutes,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), que l'urbanisation mondiale
appelle un regain dans la construction, qui exige câbles, tuyaux et
équipements électroniques et que ce n'est pas demain la veille du jour où le
cuivre sera remplacé dans sa fonction d'acheminement de l'énergie et des
fluides, achetez ce métal si vous le pouvez, mais à long terme.

##  Corrected Boeing 787 delivery delay hits ANA schedule

n"&gt;(Reuters) - All Nippon Airways (9202.T),[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the first operator of Boeing Co's
(BA.N) 787 Dreamliner, said it will postpone the start of Dreamliner service
on some international routes because of a delay in receiving another
Dreamliner.

In a statement posted on its website on Thursday,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), the Japanese
carrier blamed a "productivity reason" at Boeing for the delay. The airline
said it would delay Dreamliner service between Tokyo and Beijing and between
Tokyo and Frankfurt.

The Beijing route was scheduled to start in December,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), but has been rescheduled for
January.

"ANA regrets to take the precaution of amending international flight plans.
ANA will continue urgent negotiations with Boeing to deliver the 787 as early
and as close to the original schedule as possible,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
)," the company said.

Boeing,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), through a spokeswoman, said it was
working with ANA to deliver the airplane as quickly as possible but would not
comment on the cause of the delay.

The 787 Dreamliner is a light-weight, carbon-composite airplane that is fuel
efficient. The airplane was three years behind its development schedule but
finally entered service this year.

Boeing aims to ramp up monthly production on the airplane to 10 by the end of
2013 from the current pace of 2.5. Some experts believe the target rate is too
ambitious.

Boeing has more than 800 orders for the airplane on its books.

The latest Dreamliner snag contrasts news from Boeing's top rival Airbus
(EAD.PA),[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
which said on Friday it topped its 2011 target for superjumbo deliveries when
it handed over two A380s in rapid succession, reaching 26 deliveries for the
year.

Shares of Boeing were up 51 cents at $71.12 on the New York Stock Exchange at
mid-afternoon.

Peter O'Toole ne reconnaîtrait pas la plage de l'Algarrobico sur laquelle il a
tourné la prise d'Akaba, séquence phare de Lawrence d'Arabie. C'est pourtant
là,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), dans la province d'Almeria, au
milieu d'un paysage lunaire, de collines pelées et de falaises tombant dans
une mer turquoise, qu'en 1962 David Lean avait choisi de reconstituer le port
de Jordanie.

Aujourd'hui, si l'Algarrobico est encore célèbre, ce n'est pas pour son passé
cinématographique ni pour la beauté sauvage de sa côte. C'est pour un complexe
hôtelier abandonné, monstre de béton de 21 étages et 411 chambres, creusés
dans la montagne à moins de 30 mètres de la mer.

Chantier inachevé, paralysé en 2006 après trois ans de travaux, l'Algarrobico
est une construction doublement illégale. Parce qu'elle se trouve dans un parc
naturel protégé, celui du Cabo de Gata, l'un des derniers recoins vierges de
la côte méditerranéenne espagnole. Mais aussi parce qu'elle ne respecte pas la
"ley de costas" ("loi sur les côtes") de 1988, selon laquelle la frange de 100
mètres bordant la mer est du domaine public et donc non constructible.

Pourtant, en 2003, quand il commence le chantier, le promoteur dispose de
toutes les autorisations en règle, en dépit d'infractions évidentes à la
législation en vigueur. La municipalité lui a donné le permis de construire
pour ce "mégaprojet" de tourisme "tout inclus", qui prévoyait sept hôtels et
un terrain de golf... En plein désert. La région andalouse abaissera la
protection de la zone, parc naturel devenu urbanisable. Quant au ministère de
l'environnement,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), il ferme les yeux.

Les écologistes n'ont cessé de se battre contre l'Algarrobico, devenu le
symbole de la bulle immobilière, du massacre des côtes et de l'impunité des
hommes d'affaires et des politiciens. En cinq ans, 16 verdicts ont été rendus
contre cette aberration urbanistique. Tous confirment qu'il est illégal. Tous
appellent à sa démolition. "Qu'attendent-ils ?", demandait la banderole
déployée en septembre sur l'hôtel par un groupe d'activistes de Greenpeace.
"Il ne reste plus de recours possible. Cet hôtel doit être démoli", soulignait
alors Pilar Marcos, responsable de la campagne côtière de l'organisation
écologiste.

En réalité, il en reste encore un, déposé par le promoteur et la mairie,[sacs
louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), portant sur la légalité de la
licence des travaux. Et bien que les autres verdicts imposent la démolition,
le juge saisi du dossier s'est opposé, le 9 novembre,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), à ce qu'elle soit
mise à exécution, tant que tous les recours n'ont pas été épuisés, pour ne pas
causer de dommages "irréparables et irréversibles" au promoteur Azata del Sol.

Dans cette lutte pour reprendre les travaux, la mairie et le promoteur se sont
trouvé des alliés de choix dans les habitants du village,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), miné par le chômage et la crise, qui ont organisé des manifestations contre
les écologistes. "La nature, c'est bien beau, mais le travail c'est ce qui
nous fait vivre, explique Pilar Pinillas, propriétaire du restaurant Sol y
Playa de Carboneras, la commune où se trouve l'Algarrobico. Cet hôtel pourrait
apporter de l'emploi aux jeunes d'ici et un peu d'activité pour les
commerçants comme nous. Les écologistes disent que c'est un parc naturel, mais
c'est un caprice et ce n'est pas le moment de faire des caprices."

L'écologie n'est plus guère une préoccupation dans un pays où 21 % de la
population active est au chômage. Le promoteur en joue, qui a assuré que le
coût de la démolition et des pertes engendrées par la fermeture des lieux se
porte à 300 millions d'euros, et que la restauration du site est
"techniquement" et "physiquement impossible", car pour construire l'hôtel, "65
000 mètres cubes de béton ont été incrustés dans la montagne, qui ne pourront
pas être éliminés".

"L'Espagne n'a toujours pas retenu la leçon. Au lieu de mettre à profit les
ressources naturelles et d'opter pour un tourisme durable qui crée de
l'emploi, les gens continuent de penser que des complexes comme l'Algarrobico
pourraient être la poule aux oeufs d'or", s'insurge Pilar Marcos.

L'Espagne, descendue avec la crise de 2e à 4e puissance touristique mondiale,
doit se réinventer, le secteur en convient. "Il a été prouvé que le modèle
"tout inclus" n'est pas rentable, souligne Antonio Lopez de Avila, directeur
du master en tourism management de l'IE Business School de Madrid. Les
hôteliers espagnols se sont rendu compte qu'ils doivent augmenter les prix et
pour cela la qualité. Le touriste du XXIe siècle est très différent de celui
des années 1970. Et l'Espagne doit aujourd'hui se battre contre les marchés
turc, égyptien, tunisien et marocain,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), moins chers."

Pour cela, elle doit offrir autre chose que des complexes de béton qui
défigurent la côte, comme l'Algarrobico.

Morgan Stanley banker pleads not guilty in cab driver assaul" )]

##  Morgan Stanley banker pleads not guilty in cab driver assaul

STAMFORD, Connecticut (Reuters) - A senior Morgan Stanley banker pleaded not
guilty on Friday to hate crime, theft and assault charges stemming from an
incident last December that police say escalated from a dispute over a
$200-plus cab fare to a knife attack on the driver.

William Bryan Jennings, who had been co-head of North American fixed-income
capital markets at the Wall Street bank until being put on leave following his
arrest last month, entered "not guilty" pleas to each of three charges against
him.

Jennings, wearing a blue blazer, white shirt and royal blue tie, entered the
pleas in Stamford Superior Court. He now faces an April 12 trial date for
charges of assault, larceny and "intimidation by bigotry or bias."

If found guilty on all counts, the charges collectively carry a maximum
penalty of 11 years in jail and a fine of up to $11,000.

Jennings, a Ferrari-driving banker from Darien, a wealthy town on
Connecticut's Long Island Sound shoreline, arrived at court in a black Toyota
Tacoma pickup truck with his lawyer. No other family or friends were in
attendance at the brief arraignment hearing, although more than a dozen
reporters, photographers and videographers attended.

He remains free on a $9,500 cash bond, initially set after his arrest in
Darien on February 29.

The charges stem from a late-night cab ride last December of about 45 miles
Jennings took from Manhattan to his $2.3 million home at 39 Knollwood Lane.

Upon reaching the destination, the driver, Mohamed Helmy Ammar,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), and Jennings, who the driver said
was intoxicated, argued about the fare. According to police,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), the two had agreed
upon a fare of $204 at the outset of the ride, but when the driver requested
payment, Jennings refused.

Jennings lawyer Eugene Riccio has disputed that version of events, saying the
driver assessed a charge of nearly $300,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), which Jennings considered
excessive.

With Jennings still in the car,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), the driver began driving around the city looking
for a police officer to resolve the dispute, according to police. Riccio also
contests that, saying the driver was not looking for police, but "speeding
down the road, door open,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), disregarding traffic signals" and
threatening to bring Jennings back to Manhattan unless he paid the fare.

Ammar, who lives in Queens, New York, and is an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen,
told police that Jennings began threatening him and using racial slurs.

The banker then took out a pen knife and began stabbing at the driver through
an open partition, police said. When the driver tried to close the partition,
Jennings stabbed his hand.

The driver received immediate medical attention in Darien and later went to a
hospital where the lacerations required six stitches,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), according to Darien police.

American Airlines, pilots reach tentative contract" )]

##  American Airlines, pilots reach tentative contract

n"&gt;(Reuters) - Pilot union leaders at American Airlines reached a tentative
agreement with management on Wednesday on a steep cost-cutting contract aimed
at heading off a threat by the carrier to abandon the current deal in
bankruptcy and impose stricter terms.

The Allied Pilots Association board voted 9 to 7 to send the last and best
offer to its membership for consideration, the union and the company said.

A vote by members is expected in coming weeks, prompting the judge overseeing
American's case in New York to postpone a ruling that had been scheduled for
Friday on whether to allow the airline to abrogate the pilots' contract, the
airline said.

Ratification by pilots would end years of bitter negotiations and introduce a
measure of labor stability to American's bankruptcy.

The airline is seeking more than $1.2 billion in cost cuts from its unions
annually, a key factor in its decision to seek Chapter 11 protection from
creditors last November.

Added certainty from labor would allow the parties to shift focus to
American's planned emergence later this year and whether it will do so alone
or as part of a merger.

The six-year deal was revisited over the past several days after union board
members rejected a previous proposal from American's parent, AMR Corp
(AAMRQ.PK).

Details of the tentative deal were not released. But proposed terms disclosed
over the past few days included $315 million in annual cost savings - down
from $370 million - no layoffs,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), annual pay raises, and a stake in
the new company.

The union representing 10,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ),000 pilots
had no immediate comment beyond confirming the deal and the board's vote.

American said it believed pilots would carefully consider the proposal,[sacs
Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), which would be a watershed in the
company's restructuring if it is approved.

"We believe this agreement addresses the needs of our pilots while achieving
the goals of our business plan, and further demonstrates our commitment to
reaching consensual agreements with all of our unions," American said in a
statement.

A final agreement by pilots, the most powerful work group,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), is likely to clear the way for American's flight attendants and mechanics
also to reach new contracts. The airline said it would meet with those unions
next week.

AMR is under pressure from unions to tie up with US Airways (LCC.N). American
has said it would explore consolidation but prefers to exit bankruptcy as a
standalone company.

US Airways struck a merger deal with America West in 2005 while still in
bankruptcy,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ),
but the deal was necessary for its immediate survival.

American's case appears more along the lines of Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and
Northwest. The two emerged from their bankruptcies with similar cost
structures and then formed a partnership.

American's motion in bankruptcy court to vacate contracts follows a similar
pattern by other U.S. airlines that took the bankruptcy route.

Even in cases where carriers won court permission to throw out collective
bargaining agreements, they wound up reaching consensual deals with those
unions before exiting bankruptcy.

The case is In re AMR Corp et al,[moncler

Euro zone finmins to discuss outcome of Greek vote on Sunday" )]

##  Euro zone finmins to discuss outcome of Greek vote on Sunday

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers are scheduled to hold a
teleconference on Sunday evening to discuss the outcome of Greek elections,
two euro zone officials said on Thursday.

Greece holds a parliamentary election on Sunday and polls show that the
leftist SYRIZA party, that rejects the terms of the euro zone bailout for
Athens, is neck-and-neck with the pro-bailout New Democracy party.

If STRIZA won the election and Greece were to tear up the terms of the
bailout, France and other euro zone countries have warned that Greece could
face leaving the euro zone and returning to the drachma currency.

One euro zone official said that the main concern,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), if SYRIZA
overwhelmingly won the election, was the risk of large capital outflows from
Greece if depositors worry their savings in euros could later be frozen or
converted into drachmas.

"It is not even about a bank run on Monday morning after the elections. People
can now log on to internet banking and make transfers on Sunday evening as
well,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )," a third euro zone official said,
explaining the rationale of the ministerial call.

If a SYRIZA victory sparked panic about a return of the drachma,[sacs Louis
Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the immediate action would come
from the country's central bank,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), backed by
the European Central Bank.

The Greek central bank has the ability to directly inject cash into the
country's banks, if savers rush for their money,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), in the form of Emergency Liquidity
Assistance,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), which although provided by the ECB,
would be underwritten solely by Greece.

Top ECB officials and staff would also keep a close watch from Frankfurt and
keep in touch with other euro zone central banks, in case there were signs
that people in other countries such as Spain were starting to pull their cash
from banks.

Among the euro zone contingency plans for a possible Greek exit from the euro
are the suspension of the Schengen passport-free zone and imposing capital
controls and limiting ATM withdrawals.

The display will have a resolution of 2,880 x 1,800,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), which equates to more than 5 million total pixels and 220 pixels-per-inch. Apple's native apps will be updated to take advantage of the retina display, and Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller said developers are working on updates for other apps, including Adobe Photoshop. The laptop comes with an HDMI port, an SD card reader,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), two Thunderbolt ports and two USB 3.0/2.0 ports.

The 17-inch model of the MacBook Pro was not included in the updated lineup.

Mountain Lion:

* The latest version of the Mac operating system, OSX,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), will have improved support for Apple's Internet-based iCloud service, including a document-syncing service for Pages, Keynote, TextEdit and Preview.

* A new Notification Center will display pop-up banner notifications for events, reminders,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), messages and more. A mute switch will allow users to turn off all notifications.

* The new operating system includes Dictation compatibility that lets users bypass their keyboards to compose emails and launch applications by speaking to the computer.

* A new app, called Power Nap, allows the operating system to update while sleeping.

* Airplay mirroring will allow users to broadcast the computer's display onto an Apple TV.

##  Newmont may shift spending from costly Peru mine

(Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) will put its money into projects in
other countries if environmental changes to its proposed $4.8 billion Conga
gold mine in Peru prove economically unfeasible,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), the head of the U.S. company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We have
other options if it is not favorable," Chief Executive Officer Richard O'Brien
told Wall Street analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru's
previous government approved the Conga plan in October 2010. But after a wave
of protests by farmers and environmentalists, the new government of President
Ollanta Humala, which came into office last July, ordered a review by a panel
of independent industry experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien noted the review
confirmed that Newmont's environmental impact report for Conga met Peruvian
and international standards. But the experts recommended some changes in the
location of a waste dump near lakes to which local opponents have
objected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien said Newmont was assessing the economic
implications of the changes. "If Conga cannot be developed ... in a
safe,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), socially and environmentally responsible
manner ... then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects
in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana, and
Indonesia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newmont's plans fueled protests in the northern
Cajamarca region last year on fears the most expensive mine ever attempted in
Peru would leave local farmers without sufficient water supplies and cause
pollution. The mine's construction has been halted since
November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), Peru's Mines and Energy Minister
Jorge Merino said he would confer with officials from Denver-based Newmont to
define how the plan would be altered after a team of independent environmental
auditors recommended a series of changes that could increase the cost of the
project,.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've said they are evaluating the proposed
measures recommended by the auditors,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), but I think there's a good willingness on their
part," Merino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auditors' recommendations called for
the company to preserve two of four alpine lakes that would be displaced by
the mine and replaced with reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Humala has
urged community activists to stop protesting against the stalled mine's
construction and said the government would make sure the company adheres to
strict social, environmental and labor goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During
Friday's conference call to discuss Newmont's first-quarter earnings, O'Brien
noted Conga is a significant investment in Peru, near Newmont's Yanacocha
mine,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), the largest gold producer in Latin
America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Conga's development would be a significant source
of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant
employment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted Newmont has been operating in Peru for
more than 20 years, "and we want to continue to be part of the government's
social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through
responsible mining."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Newmont's first-quarter
profit beat Wall Street estimates as gold prices outpaced higher labor and
power costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings were $561 million, or $1.13 per share,
compared with $514 million, or $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter.
Adjusted for certain items,[sacs Louis Vuitton

"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the profit was $1.15 per share,
which beat the analysts' average estimate of $1.14 per share, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.68

##  Analysis Beauty industry sees growth at its fingertips

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Nail varnish has become the top-selling fashion
accessory, replacing lipstick as an affordable indulgence in austere times and
leading to a boom in sales as consumers flock to buy bright-colored
bottles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industry insiders predict nail color will be the
fastest-growing beauty business in the next few years, providing a small yet
promising pocket of growth for beauty groups such as Coty and L'Oreal who have
led the rush to snap up independent brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In France, over
the whole of 2010,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), perfume sales in department stores rose 2 percent.
Over the same period nail color jumped 42 percent,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), according to global market
research company NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used to measure the economy with
the lipstick index - when times got tough, we bought a lipstick. Now the
economic barometer is measured by nail polish: as times get difficult, you buy
a nail polish,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," said Suzi Weiss-Fischmann, co-founder
and artistic director of OPI, a U.S. nail polish company acquired last year by
perfume maker Coty COTY.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a small thing that makes
you feel good and brings you instant gratification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nail
polish is still a small sub-sector of the global beauty industry compared to
other make-up items such as lipstick, and looks even smaller when compared to
perfume, but it is on its way to becoming an important business, analysts
say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing an explosion in many countries," said
Karen Grant, senior global analyst and vice-president of NPD's beauty
division, mentioning the United States, France and Britain as
examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She likened the trajectory of nail varnish sales
to that of lip gloss, a niche business which saw sales grow tenfold over the
past decade. "If the nail polish market continues to grow, it could also
become a big category," Grant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., nail polish
sales from department stores and mass market retailers excluding Walmart, rose
22 percent to $337 million in the six months to June 30, she said. Over the
whole of 2010, sales rose 15 percent to $530 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
Europe, the total mass market value of the nail polish market grew twice as
fast as the overall make-up market, jumping 29 percent between 2007 and 2010
while the broader make-up market rose 17 percent, based on figures from
Nielsen and IRI research cited by L'Oreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nail bars, which
have mushroomed in big U.S. cities, have become increasingly prevalent on
Europe's high streets in recent years, targeting women seeking a small morale-
boost at a small price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZANY NAMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of
the most coveted shades go by zany names. But the pace at which consumers are
buying them is attracting the most hard-headed experts in the
industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPI, whose bright red shade "My Chihuahua bites"
sells for around 14 euros a bottle, expects volumes this year to jump to 50
million bottles from 30 million bottles in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPI, the
market leader in professional salons, made over $200 million in sales in 2010
and expects to be close to $300 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernd
Beetz, chief executive of Coty and a seasoned beauty industry manager, oversaw
the acquisition of OPI last year and estimates the nail market to be growing
at around 20 percent a year, compared to just 4-5 percent growth in the make-
up market and 2-3 percent growth in perfume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the
nail market will continue to grow in double-digit terms over the next few
years, driven by innovation and expansion in new markets," Beetz told Reuters
in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Coty snapped up OPI, competitor L'Oreal
(OREP.PA) bought rival brand Essie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other beauty groups are
now on the prowl for other independent nail brands to reduce their exposure to
a mature and overcrowded perfume market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targets include
Nailstation in France, Art Deco in Germany and Britain's Nails Inc, whose
revenues in the year to June rose 20 percent and profits
tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nails Inc sells nail polish to retailers such as
Boots and Sephora,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), owned by luxury giant LVMH (LVMH.PA). The
privately-owned company said recently it had rejected approaches from private
equity groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathalie Duran, deputy head of Yves Saint
Laurent's make-up and perfume operation -- owned by L'Oreal -- shares Beetz's
optimism about the nail market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (nail color) is a way
for women to change their allure without changing their clothes. I think the
trend will continue and will become increasingly sophisticated,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" )," she told Reuters in an
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAIL COUTURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-end
luxury brands have been in on the act for a while. Chanel's "Rouge Noir" -
designed to be the same color as dried blood -- caused a storm among
fashionistas when movie star Uma Thurman wore it in the 1994 movie Pulp
Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Chanel lit the latest surge of
interest about two years ago with a range of original colors including 505 -
"particuliere" -- a mud-colored mix of purple, brown and grey which proved a
smash with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nail polish from Chanel, Dior or Yves
Saint Laurent - the market's luxury brand leaders - costs around 21 euros
compared to OPI's 14 euros. That is a discount compared to luxury perfumes
which start at around 50 euros and lipsticks at 25-30
euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now other labels are taking
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Vogue Fashion Night Out on September 8,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), an event created three years ago by
the glossy magazine to encourage people to shop in fashion capitals such as
Paris, New York, Milan and London, there were nail bars at many fashion brands
for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubbing shoulders with Chanel and Dior
were labels like Barbara Bui (BBUI.PA) in Paris and Karen Millen in London --
which so far have no beauty products lines but set up nail polish stations in
their shops that evening nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nail color has become
the fashion accessory par excellence," says Elisabeth Martorell, deputy editor
in chief of the beauty section of Elle magazine in France. "It is also open to
all age categories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

##  WaMu shareholders to probe hedge funds' trades

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), Delaware (Reuters) - Washington Mutual
Inc shareholders were given permission by a judge on Tuesday to investigate
allegations of insider trading against hedge funds that helped craft the
company's reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Owl Creek Asset Management
LP,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), Appaloosa Management LP,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), Centerbridge Partners LP and
Aurelius Capital Management LP were accused in December by investor Nate Thoma
of using their positions to profit on trades in the company's
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Delaware bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath
treated the allegations as hearsay, she cited the claims in her January
opinion rejecting the company's reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
four hedge funds have large holdings of various Washington Mutual securities
and were part of a settlement of legal disputes at the heart of the rejected
reorganization plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An attorney representing the funds did
not immediately return a call for comment. In court documents, the funds
called the allegations "baseless" and "last-gasp point of
leverage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual filed a new plan on Tuesday
aimed at resolving Walrath's criticisms. Notably, the hedge funds were no
longer part of the settlement and it scrapped a rights offering that would
have put them in control of the company's post-bankruptcy business, which will
have valuable tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual said in a
statement the hedge funds were no longer part of the settlement because they
did not want to extend its termination date. The prior settlement expired on
January 31 and the new settlement expires April
30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual needs approval of its amended
bankruptcy plan to begin distributing more than $7 billion to its creditors,
which range from hedge funds holding bonds to suppliers such as software
suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new plan also rolls back the number of
parties protected from being sued. The company said in court documents that no
party that voted to approve the previous plan is adversely affected in the
amended version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual filed for bankruptcy in
September 2008 after regulators seized its savings and loan, which was the
biggest bank failure in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spent the first 18
months in bankruptcy fighting with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp,[sacs
Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), which sold the seized bank, and
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), which bought it for $1.88 billion, over the
ownership of assets and blame for the bank failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
company reached a settlement last year that divided $10 billion of assets and
ended the legal disputes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than a rights offering, the
company plans to distribute the reorganized company's stock to creditors. The
company said it could still decide to liquidate or sell its remaining
business,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), which centers around a mortgage
reinsurer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also denied a request by shareholders
to appeal to the Circuit Court her finding that the company's settlement was
fair. They will have to appeal to a lower District Court
instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Washington Mutual, U.S.

Analysis  Big business scores key Supreme Court term wins" )]

##  Analysis Big business scores key Supreme Court term wins

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Giant retailer Wal-Mart Inc,
telecommunications company AT&amp;T Inc and coal power companies came out the
big winners in the U.S. Supreme Court's just-ended term that rejected large
lawsuits against them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high court threw out the largest
sex-discrimination lawsuit in U.S. history by Wal-Mart's female employees,
ruled for AT&amp;T in favoring arbitration over big class actions and ended a
global warming lawsuit against the utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite some
losses, businesses prevailed in the biggest cases, provoking criticism by
liberal groups that the court's five-member conservative majority shielded
companies from suits seeking to protect workers, consumers or the
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a pro-business court," said Steven
Shapiro,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), the national legal director of the
American Civil Liberties Union, in assessing the 2010-11 term that ended on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, the instinct to protect business
interests often comes at the expense of ordinary citizens looking for
justice," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other rulings held a mutual fund's
investment adviser cannot be sued for securities fraud over misstatements in
fund prospectuses and gave greater protection to generic drug companies and
vaccine makers from liability lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the term's last
day, the court struck down a California law banning the sale or rental of
violent video games to minors for violating free-speech rights, a landmark
victory for video game publishers, distributors and
sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leland Yee,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), a California state senator who authored the
law,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
said, "The Supreme Court once again put the interests of corporate America
before the interests of our children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT BEST OR WORST
TERM FOR BUSINESS GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Conrad,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), head of the legal arm of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, rejected the notion of a pro-business court and said its
term had produced mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It goes without saying
that this was not our best Supreme Court term. But it's not been our worst
term either,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )," she said, acknowledging that
business won the three most important cases -- Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T arbitration
and the global warming lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business favors arbitration
and individual lawsuits, rather than massive class-action lawsuits with big
groups of plaintiffs that have often led to payouts of billions of
dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Andrew Pincus, who frequently argues
before the Supreme Court and who served as Commerce Department general counsel
in the Clinton administration, said businesses lost as many cases as they won
this term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In prepared testimony for a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing to be held on Wednesday, Pincus said his analysis of
decisions in which business prevailed showed the plaintiffs urged radical
changes from existing law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses suffered losses this
term when the court upheld an Arizona law that penalizes employers who hire
illegal immigrations, ruled companies have no privacy right to stop disclosure
of government records about them and reaffirmed that some class-action
securities fraud lawsuits can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many pro-business
rulings came by a 5-4 vote, splitting along conservative-liberal ideological
lines that have divided the court for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
conservative bloc consists of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel
Alito, both appointees of then-President George W. Bush,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony
Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liberal faction consist of Justices Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and President Barack Obama's two appointees -- Sonia
Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court adjourned for its
traditional summer recess and is scheduled to return to the bench in October
for a new term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Cynthia

Icahn buys Chesapeake stake, seeks board changes" )]

##  Icahn buys Chesapeake stake, seeks board changes

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn revealed he had
bought a 7.6 percent stake in Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) and called for
the natural gas producer to replace at least four directors, saying the board
has failed "in a dramatic fashion" in its oversight of management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corporate-raider-turned-activist investor asked the company for
two board seats for his own representatives and two for another large
shareholder such as Chesapeake's largest, Southeastern Asset
Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was the latest in a saga that has seen
the company come under intense pressure from investors to improve its
corporate governance after Reuters reported in April that Chesapeake Chief
Executive Aubrey McClendon had taken out more than $1 billion in loans using
his personal stakes in thousands of company wells as
collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's move had been widely rumored, and
McClendon told analysts earlier this month he would not be surprised if Icahn
bought in, since he had made hundreds of millions of dollars in the stock last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn blasted the company in a letter to
Chesapeake's board of directors, saying its earlier promises to act in a more
financially responsible way had proven hollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This board
has led the company through a highly publicized spate of corporate governance
breakdowns while amassing an astounding $16 billion funding gap, which we
believe has contributed to the share price decline of over 55 percent from the
52-week high,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," Icahn wrote in a letter to the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn holds 50.1 million shares in the
company,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), according to a regulatory filing.
That would make him the third-largest shareholder in the company,[sacs Louis
Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), according to Thomson Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stifel Nicolaus analyst Neal Dingmann said the move by
Icahn would be a distraction as the company raced to complete two key asset
sales in the coming months amid the weakest natural gas prices in a
decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does add another layer or another level of
complication when the primary focus should be getting the asset sales done,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake said in a statement that its board's
immediate priority is finding an independent chairman for the company. The
company said that once that task is finished, the board will review Icahn's
request for representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DINNER WITH
AUBREY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said in the letter he had recently had dinner
with McClendon to discuss the company's funding gap and suggest new
shareholder representation on the board, but was told that no changes to its
makeup would be considered before a new chairman was brought
in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In calling for four board members to be replaced, Icahn
singled out only Louis Simpson,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), the former Geico executive, as one who should
remain on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn had bought a 5.8 percent stake in
Chesapeake in December 2010, prompting the Oklahoma City company to sell more
than $4.5 billion in assets, a move that drove its stock higher in early
2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, the company accelerated its aggressive
land purchases and spent money to operate non-core assets, Icahn
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Southeastern Asset Management,
Chesapeake's largest shareholder,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), urged the company to sell more assets or consider a sale of the entire
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake, which earlier this month arranged a
pricey $4 billion loan from its investment bankers to tide it over, has said
it will sell as much as $11.5 billion in assets this year as it scrambles to
raise cash to close its cash shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chesapeake shares,
which had dropped 29 percent so far this year through Friday's close,[Moncler

"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), gained 1.5 percent in post-market

##  So, you want to be an online entrepreneur, huh

&lt;p&gt; I spend countless hours counseling and mentoring people who are
attempting to start businesses, who are either trying to use the internet as a
primary marketing tool, or who are trying to run completely online businesses.
Many of my mentees are frustrated. They were either lured into their
businesses by some slick advertising, or started their businesses thinking
that an internet business would be a simple thing to make money with.  
  
The exasperation many of the people I work with feel is completely
understandable. My job is to explain to them the realities of an "internet"
business. My purpose in writing this article is to help some of you, who are
in the same or a similar situation, to understand the realities of internet
business, and to encourage you that there is a paycheck, if not a pot of gold,
at the end of the internet rainbow.  
  
So, here are a couple of principles regarding starting and running an internet
business.  
  
1\. Don't believe the people who say it's easy!  
  
Running an internet business, running a multi-level marketing business, or
running a brick and mortar business all have something in common: It takes
work, skill and knowledge to be successful. You never, never,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), never get something for nothing.
And running a successful business requires hard work and dedication. One of
the reasons that "brick and mortar" business are successful is that the owners
have a huge financial commitment upfront. Much of the time, because it doesn't
cost a great deal of money to start an internet business or an MLM business,
the level of commitment required to succeed just isn't there. You have to
treat your MLM business or your internet business just the same as though you
had mortgaged your house to start your business.  
  
2\. Running a Successful Internet Business Requires knowledge and skill  
  
Twitter, Facebook, Articles,[coach
outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), Blogs,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), Craigs List ...
the list is almost endless. And because social networking is so new, the
rules, and the way to be successful change almost daily. In order to find
success on the internet, you must be dedicated to learning as much as
possible. Subscribe to blogs. With a little digging, you can find thousands of
free sites and free blogs you can subscribe to to learn what,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )!) available to you to learn. It's
easy to get sucked into buying people's "programs" for success,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), when, in truth, there's a lot of great, free
information availabe if you want to learn. But you absolutely must learn!  
  
3\. Work Hard  
  
It sounds cliche,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), but the truth is that you can't be
successful if you're not willing to put in the time and effort required to be
successful. Anyone who tells you that all you need to do is put up a website
and deposit your checks, is dead wrong. It doesn't matter whether you are
opening a running store on main street or an internet business, you have got
to put in the hours required to be successful.

Draghi skips Jackson Hole ahead of pivotal ECB meeting" )]

##  Draghi skips Jackson Hole ahead of pivotal ECB meeting

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
will not attend the annual Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers at the end
of this week due to a heavy workload, the ECB said on Tuesday as its
policymakers gear up for a critical meeting on September 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draghi had been expected to speak at the Jackson Hole
gathering,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), but the retreat in the U.S. state
of Wyoming falls just as ECB policymakers are hammering out the details of a
new bond-buying plan aimed at tackling the euro zone debt
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECB policymaker Joerg Asmussen stressed on Monday
that the bank's policymakers were still working on operational and technical
details of the plan,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), which is aimed at easing the crippling borrowing
costs facing Spain and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether Draghi was
no longer planning to attend the Jackson Hole meeting,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), an ECB spokesman said: "That's correct ... He has a very heavy workload in
the coming days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the ECB's six-member Executive
Board, the nucleus of the broader 23-man Governing Council, would attend the
gathering of top policymakers hosted by the Federal
Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann
still plans to go, the German central bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB is
being forced to take a greater role in fighting the euro zone crisis while
governments negotiate legal and political hurdles to coordinating a longer-
term response,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), but Germany's Bundesbank wants to limit
the scope of ECB action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weidmann stepped up his opposition
to the ECB's latest moves to battle the euro zone's debt crisis on
Sunday,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), saying the plans to buy bonds
risked becoming a drug on which governments would get
hooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to assuage Weidmann's concerns, Asmussen
said on Monday the new program will ensure countries whose bonds the ECB buys
do not soft-peddle reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asmussen did not say when the
ECB would begin buying bonds but made clear the plan could go ahead despite
Bundesbank opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Carrel and Andreas

Analysis  Self-regulation the way forward for oil" )]

##  Analysis Self-regulation the way forward for oil

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - While governments and regulators dither,
IntercontinentalExchange energy hub has moved ahead of the curve, with steps
to boost transparency that could increase the lure of its flagship Brent
contract over its U.S. rival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every Monday,[coach
outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), ICE Futures Europe (ICE.N) will
publish a breakdown of what kind of traders are active on its Brent and gasoil
contracts, widely viewed as its most useful, global pricing
benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measure is imposed by the exchange, not the
regulator, but narrows the regulatory gap between the ICE Brent contract and
the world's most liquid futures contract U.S. futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The move was long due and it
is smart of the ICE to do it on a voluntary basis," said Olivier Jakob of
Petromatrix, who has published forensic analysis of the U.S. regulator's data
and will now scrutinize the ICE figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ICE wants
Brent to be the global crude oil benchmark and that would have been difficult
without some added transparency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, the U.S.
regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has produced a
weekly breakdown of market participants for the range of commodities
futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division was previously into commercial and
non-commercial, loosely considered resource-holding companies and speculators
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2009 and phased in across
different commodities, the categories have been redefined as producers, swap
dealers, money managers and other reportables. The ICE has opted to use the
same more granular divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until this week's
announcement, some traders had argued the lack of transparency on ICE relative
to NYMEX could be an incentive to trade there for maker players seeking
anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the event,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), analysts and traders said transparency was a
good thing, as was self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's better to have a
trading environment self-regulated rather than having the government tell you
what to do," said one trader at an investment bank who asked to remain
anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the pioneers of the move into commodities
as an asset class, who asked not to be named, said ultimately fundamentals of
supply and demand still mattered most of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The larger
factor causing any investors to move their crude positions from WTI to Brent
is their belief in the underlying fundamental economics of the two markets,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRENT STRENGTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late last
year, Brent has enjoyed unusual strength relative to the U.S. futures contract
and its premium to U.S. futures on NYMEX reached a record of more than $23 a
barrel earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volumes of trade on ICE's Brent
still lags its U.S. equivalent U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate
(WTI), but in terms of percentage growth has
outperformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gasoil has been particularly strong and in May
around 4.9 million futures contracts traded,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ), compared with around
2.6 million for heating oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many kinds of player,
including long-term investors, such as pension funds as well as those seeking
shorter term exposure, increased transparency is one more reason to buy and
sell Brent rather than landlocked U.S. crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the
two will flip in share. WTI will have the share that Brent had five years ago
and vice versa," said a hedge fund trader based in New York who asked not to
be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My view is that the oil market players have
gotten more broad and as such have realized that a waterborne marker is a much
better indicator than a land-locked one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakob said the
breakdown could allay suspicion Brent's strength relative to U.S. crude meant
Brent as well as U.S. futures had lost its connection to underlying physical
reality and was distorted by trading plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It should stop
the baseless speculation about price making manipulation in Brent," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price impact is hard to quantify. But if traders
knew speculators were net long, that might limit their appetite to also buy,
which could prevent price trends being exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you
see speculators are looking long,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), it might put you off going long
yourself. You might think it's looking over-bought," said Tony Machacek of
Bache Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of speculative and investment-
class money, as opposed to buying and selling by producers and major consumers
has been the subject of lengthy debate, but no-one has ever proved whether it
inflates oil and other commodity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators and
governments, increasingly desperate to rein in rising commodity prices,[Canada
Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), are pressing
for reforms, but so far they have been mired in the
process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said it would not introduce long-awaited position limit plans for
commodities soon. [ID:nN1599324]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Financial
Services Authority, which regulates ICE's Brent and gasoil contracts,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), is regarded as
light-touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of ICE Europe said it worked in
close collaboration with the regulators on both sides of the
Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The exchange continues to have a very important
role in regulating the markets, but we work very closely with the regulators
including the FSA in the UK and the CFTC in the U.S. We share information on a
daily basis," David Peniket told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt; Related

Exclusive  Merrill MVPs earn half firm's revenue, big payche" )]

##  Exclusive Merrill MVPs earn half firm's revenue, big payche

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The multimillion-dollar signing bonuses that big
brokerages are doling out to recruit elite brokers may seem excessive, but
internal reports from Merrill Lynch show why firms are willing to pay top
dollar for a top broker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly 46 percent of the revenue
received by Merrill Lynch's Global Wealth Management unit last year came from
just 21 percent of its top-producing brokers, about 2,500 people, according to
copies of the reports reviewed by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monthly
reports, available internally as a performance scorecard, provide a rare look
inside Merrill, revealing just how far ahead the top one-fifth of advisers are
from the rest of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reports do not detail each
adviser's revenue contribution,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), but they help provide the best estimate of
Merrill's top performers. The reports divide brokers into smaller groups and
provide average revenue and compensation credit figures,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), which Reuters used to calculate take-home pay
and estimated revenue for each group of brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year,
the top 2,400 brokers generated an average of $2.5 million each in revenue for
Merrill, double the average of advisers in the next 20 percent,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), who brought in $1.2 million each
on average, according to a report that covered the full
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revenue figures, which include money the firm
receives from products that brokers sell and any additional money earned from
managing client assets,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), underscore why Wall Street
brokerages are in an arms race for talent: Elite performers account for an
outsized portion of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly the top 20 percent of
brokers are far and away the best of the best," said Michael Kostoff, managing
partner with the wealth management consultancy The Kostoff Group based in
Washington. "These are the guys everyone wants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some firms,
like UBS,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), have paid bonuses of up to double those
paid by rivals for elite brokers. UBS has hired at least 28 top brokers away
from Merrill so far this year, according to Reuters data. And most brokerages
are offering far more in sign-on bonuses than they have in years
past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill declined to comment for this
story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management,
the brokerage business, totaled $13.5 billion last year, ahead of its closest
rival, Morgan Stanley, which reported revenue of $13.4 billion for its global
wealth management group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The internal Merrill reports also
show that not all brokers in the firm's famous "Thundering Herd" are bringing
money into the firm. The number of revenue-producing brokers at the end of
2011 was 12,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ),107, compared with the firm's public
total broker headcount - excluding the consumer banking division - of
16,165.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trainees likely make up most of the difference,
industry experts said. Internal figures obtained by Reuters show a similar gap
at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney - the firm had 13,745 revenue-producing brokers
as of March. It reported having 17,193 advisers in its first quarter
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Merrill reports also show:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*
About 4,500 advisers brought in an average of $1 million or more in revenue
for the firm. Of those, about 1,450 brokers with 10 or more years of
experience brought in more than $2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The average
revenue brought in by all revenue-producing brokers was nearly $1.1
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Top brokers likely got paid an average of nearly
$1 million last year, about 22 times more than the lowest performers,
according to Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Just 12 percent of
advisers - those in the top one-fifth of all brokers by revenue generation -
with 10 or more years of experience accounted for an estimated 32 percent of
the wealth business's annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broker production, a
figure that counts revenue that earns a broker a commission or fee, is listed
on a separate report that advisers often use to keep score of where they are
against the pack. Generally in the industry, every $1 million in production
translates into about $100 million in client assets under
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill has about $1.8 trillion in managed
assets, brokerage assets, deposits and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poaching an
elite broker is one of the only quick ways to bring more revenue to a firm. It
can take a decade for a new adviser to build $100 million in client
money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So firms are paying more and more to attract top
producers. The best candidates can get up to $5 million in bonuses by taking
an offer from another firm and staying for the full length of their contract
of about nine years, said Courtney Raymond, a recruiter for Merrill and
founder of Houston-based Courtney Raymond Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
size of bonuses have become "astronomical," she said. "We didn't think it
could get so high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE ELITE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy
Tasnady, founder of Port Washington, New York-based consulting firm Tasnady
&amp; Associates LLC that serves wealth management firms, said outperformance
is often skewed to a small cluster at the top in sales-oriented businesses
such as brokerages, pharmaceutical companies and
insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill's high performers may be outliers because
they have built up exposure to the wealthy and often work on teams, which
allows them to pool resources to bring in more money and offer sought-after
specialty expertise to ever-wealthier clients, experts
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best have it all: specialized skills, a good
process, and an excellent network," Kostoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While top
candidates get eye-popping bonuses, other big producers are paid handsomely
for their skills. The top 20 percent of brokers at Merrill earned an average
of $670,000 last year, before deferred compensation, which can be $78,000 or
much more for advisers at this level, according to calculations by Reuters
using the data in Merrill's internal reports and the company's 2012
compensation plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most elite brokers, numbering about
680, brought in an average of $3.3 million in revenue to Merrill and earned
$893,000 last year on average, plus average deferred compensation of $103,000
or more, according to Reuters calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile a
broker in the bottom 20 percent brought in an average of $233,000 in revenue
and made about $45,000 last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the elite brokers
have been leaving Merrill. All told, at least 78 advisers who managed nearly
$15 billion in client assets at Merrill have left since January 1, based on
moves of advisers and teams managing a minimum of about $100 million in client
assets tracked by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Smith Barney lost
at least 87 advisers who managed about $7.2 billion in client assets; UBS lost
30 advisers who managed $2.9 billion; and 48 advisers who left Wells Fargo
managed at least $1.9 billion, according to Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The money is really at a supreme level right now,"
said Tom Lewis, a New Jersey-based lawyer with Stark &amp; Stark, who helps
brokers with legal matters when they change firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A top
adviser would be foolish not to entertain the proposals that are out there,"
Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version of the story corrects Morgan
Stanley global wealth management group revenue to $13.4 billion for 2011 in

##  APEC ponders free trade area as frictions loom

&lt;p&gt;YOKOHAMA (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific economies, including China and the
United States, were laying the groundwork on Sunday for a vast free trade
area,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), but frictions over currencies and
geopolitical rivalries threatened to undermine regional harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and the United States turned down the heat in an acrimonious
dispute over currencies and trade imbalances at a meeting of finance ministers
from the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting in Japan's ancient capital of Kyoto on
Saturday, the finance chiefs declared members will move toward more market-
determined exchange rate systems reflecting underlying economic fundamentals,
and refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters on Saturday that while
there was now broad consensus to develop some form of policy framework to
avoid excessive current account imbalances,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), specific targets should not be
expected from a Group of 20 summit in Seoul on Nov 11 and 12, just ahead of an
APEC summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not something you can reduce easily to a
single number,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," Geithner said. He had earlier suggested
countries should aim to cut surpluses or deficits to a targeted share of gross
domestic product over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner was also forced to fend
off criticism that the United States was deliberately weakening the dollar
after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced last week it was in effect running
the printing presses to buy another $600 billion in government bonds in an
effort to reinvigorate the flagging U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series
of APEC meetings in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo, will conclude next weekend
in a summit that brings together U.S. President Barack Obama, Chinese
President Hu Jintao Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and other leaders of
fast-growing nations around the Pacific rim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APEC members
have signed more than 100 bilateral and other mini-free trade agreements with
each other, and stitching them together somehow into an area that accounts for
44 percent of global trade is an ambitious task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOT MONEY
INFLOWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think FTAAP is a very good idea,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" )," Asian Development
Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda said in an interview on Sunday, referring to
the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than doing
bilaterally or with a small number of countries, free trade deals work better
when more countries get involved because that will not only benefit member
countries but also reduce the negative impact on non-member nations, and that
could be a plus for the global economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuroda said
regional coordination was needed to deal with the differing rates at which
currencies are appreciating in Asia's hot emerging
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Southeast Asian currencies are appreciating, but
the Chinese one is not. There is a gap among emerging market
currencies,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," Kuroda said. "This is causing a big
problem, so we need to talk more about currency cooperation in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If regional coordination and cooperation progress,
it will help ease global imbalances," Kuroda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital
inflows into developing countries have been massive. Flows into emerging
market funds reached $46.4 billion in the year to the fourth week of October
compared with $9.4 billion for all of 2009, according to Global fund tracker
EPFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has prompted some emerging economies to implement
capital controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuroda said capital controls were
necessary for countries that face problems of hot money inflows, which could
be reversible in the short term. But controls on inflows that are mainly for
long-term investments should be avoided, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need
to look at the type of capital inflows, whether a country has a strong,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), supervised financial
system or not. When a country's economy is overheating and needs to stop such
inflows, it (capital control) is needed," Kuroda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But
if that's not that case, you don't need it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transpacific
PARTNERSHIP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama, who will attend the APEC summit in the
wake of his Democratic Party's disastrous showing at the polls, is now on a
10-day Asian tour aimed at boosting exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is
also pushing a nine-member Transpacific Partnership (TPP) free trade
initiative. Japan said on Saturday it would start talking with other countries
about the U.S.-led deal, but stopped short of pledging to join negotiations
formally, reflecting worries over the fallout for
farmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the potential for contention at APEC are
security strains as the region confronts an increasingly assertive China,
itself impatient with U.S. efforts to shore up
influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokyo, Washington and Southeast Asian nations
have grown increasingly wary of China's intentions as it spends heavily to
modernise its military, sends its navy further afield and asserts sovereignty
over the contested South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sino-Japanese relations
have chilled markedly due to a feud over claims to isles in the East China Sea
near potentially huge maritime gas and oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia
also leapt into the fray this week when President Dmitry Medvedev visited part
of an island chain north of Japan claimed by both countries, sparking another

##  Instant View Consumer spending rises 0.7 percent

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than
expected in February for the eighth straight month of gains as households
tapped their savings,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), government data showed on Monday,
while inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since June 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said spending rose 0.7 percent
after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in January. * Economists polled by
Reuters had expected spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S.
economic activity,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), to advance 0.6 percent in February
after a previously reported 0.2 percent
rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF
MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The
PCE numbers will help both sides of the QE dispute. Inflation is higher but
not by enough to worry Bernanke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAUL DALES, SENIOR US
ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, TORONTO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"February's U.S.
personal and income spending data provide yet more evidence that higher prices
are denting economic growth. The 0.3 percent m/m increase in nominal income
was not too bad - incomes were up by 5.1 percent in the last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But as prices are rising at a faster rate, real
incomes fell, by 0.1 percent m/m. That's the first drop since
September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Similarly, higher prices, especially for
gasoline,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), meant that the decent 0.7 percent m/m gain in
nominal spending translated into a modest 0.3 percent m/m increase in real
spending. That's better than in either of the previous two months,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), but it's still not much to shout
about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if real spending were to increase by 0.3
percent m/m in March, real consumption in the first quarter will grow at an
annualized rate of between 2.0 percent and 2.5 percent. That would suggest the
4.1 percent gain seen in the fourth quarter of last year was just another
false dawn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BNY MELLON
GLOBAL MARKETS, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Judging from the CPI, PPI and PCE
data, core inflation has bottomed and begun to rise, albeit at a glacial pace.
From Bernanke's perspective, today's data reaffirms the need to maintain the
current QE II program until inflation and unemployment return to more
desirable levels. At the same time, the personal savings rate remains
comfortably above the 5.0 percent level, despite signs that the consumer
spending is picking up. Without explicit evidence of inflationary problems in
the core, it is difficult to imagine Bernanke's dovish position being altered
in any material way. Plosser's comments on Friday not withstanding, it is
premature to expect any sustained campaign of monetary tightening from the
Fed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAYNE KAUFMAN,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS
FINANCIAL, NEW YORK:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All these numbers look reasonably in
line, so there's no surprise. You're seeing really a nil reaction in
futures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT
CAPITAL, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The headlines were close to
consensus expectations but some of the underlying components are a bit
tedious. Real PCE and income gains were tame to say the least versus their
nominal components showing that higher prices are behind most of the gains
versus a real increase in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, higher prices
represent a tax in the sense incomes are not holding pace. Real income ex
transfer were 0 percent. Thus Q1 GDP looks weaker than the consensus forecasts
at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bond market, of course, is weaker as it
faces supply and the curve is pretty steady through it all. Is it a focus on
inflation implied in this report? We're not sure but suspect supply is its own
'reward.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANK LESH, A FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER,
FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), CHICAGO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The consumption number
was good and that is supportive for the market. There was some thought that
consumer spending might not be holding up in the current environment and this
says those worries may be unfounded -- at least for the time
being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures
hold slight gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices widen their losses. FOREX:
The dollar holds steady at higher levels versus the euro and yen.&lt;/p&gt;

3 Tips To Find The Best SEO Tutorial Online" )]

##  3 Tips To Find The Best SEO Tutorial Online

&lt;p&gt; If you're in internet business, you know how competitive it is. It's
essential to get an edge over competitors to get some extra traffic and more
conversions. The easiest way to get ahead of your competitors is to do some
SEO tutorials and find out some sneaky tricks no one else knows.  
  
SEO, short for search engine optimization,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), is a great start to drive traffic
to your website. It's a traffic strategy that allows you to rank highly in the
search engines,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), thereby capturing what is called
organic traffic (meaning traffic that is nor paid for per click or visitor).
This has become a necessity for any web based business simply because it is
the best way to reach the most people with the least expense. SEO is generally
regarded as being a 'free' traffic generation strategy,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), as it doesn't have
the same cost as pay-per-click advertising (for example).  
  
But website optimization requires a lot of time and expertise to learn the
skills, apply them and wait for the results. Results can take 3 to 6 months to
kick in, depending on the competition for your chosen keywords. Alternatively,
you can of course choose to outsource your search engine optimization to a
specialist, which can cost from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars,
depending on the provider you choose.  
  
If you choose to learn how to do search engine optimization yourself, you're
well advised to check out some SEO tutorials. SEO can be confusing when you
first start. To avoid information overload, you want to find an easy-to-
understand tutorial to get you started.  
  
When choosing a search engine optimization tutorial, you want to look for the
following three things:  
  
1\. Provides a basic Overview - In the beginning it's best to focus on the
basic, but important aspects of SEO, rather than getting involved in the
technical details. Instead find a tutorial that will give you a basic overview
of the most effective techniques. 20 percent of your effort will give you 80
percent of your results.  
  
2\. Easy to Read - As a beginner it's much easier to understand a tutorial
that's easy to read and doesn't use much jargon.  
  
3\. Links to additional resources - Once you've learnt about the basics of
website optimization, you might be interested in going deeper on some of the
topics. In that instance, having additional resources and links really pays
off.  
  
While having the best value offer is important, you also need to get visitors
to your website so the word about your offer can spread. Like any website,
business or sale,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"
), the old adage of 'Build it and they will come' does not apply. So learning
the basics of search engine optimization through SEO tutorials is a great
first step to beating your competitors.  
  
  
\------------------------------  
  
Out of all the SEO tutorials I have looked at,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), this SEO ebook is my favourite. It
discusses the vital topics of SEO,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), such as keyword research, on-page optimization and link building, yet it's
easy to understand with a navigation menu and search function. Get your free

##  BlackRock CEO Fink says equities are still cheap

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Chairman and CEO Laurence Fink said on
Wednesday he still believes U.S. equities are attractive even with their solid
rise so far this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We still have a long ways to go to
make equities look expensive,[coach

trillion asset management firm BlackRock (BLK.N),[moncler

"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), told an audience at the Council on
Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index .SPX -
which closed above the May 2011 intraday high of 1,370.58 on Tuesday - is up
more than 9 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk has made a huge comeback
this year on signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, including job growth,
manufacturing and consumer confidence,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), as well as an
attractive risk-reward ratio on equities relative to other asset
classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fink, who spoke at CFR as part of a CEO Speaker
Series,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), said
dividend-paying stocks, multinationals and investment-grade-rated corporate
bonds should be a part of investors' portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked on
the sidelines about the housing market and investor activity, Fink told
Reuters: "You are starting to see the speculative fervor come in as we start
bottoming out. But we have another 1-1/2 years of indigestion. We still have
excess homes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds,[pochette louis

), private equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors are looking to scoop
up foreclosed homes and earn money by renting them out. The Federal Housing
Finance Agency, which regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, last year received
proposals from hundreds of investment groups interested in acquiring and
renting out single-family homes federal agencies have foreclosed
on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fink also addressed China's economy, saying "I don't
think China is slowing down in 2012" and that China is easing, which will help
to re-stimulate the economy. He also praised the present leadership in
China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fink said that the European Central Bank's long-term
refinancing operation is solving many problems but that Europe remains
vulnerable without fundamental growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sam

Lawmakers set to trade partisan punches over taxes" )]

##  Lawmakers set to trade partisan punches over taxes

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and congressional
Republicans square off this week over tax hikes for millionaires and tax cuts
for businesses, with little expected to be accomplished beyond the winning of
political points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although chances are slim to none that
any measure will become law ahead of the November 6 general election,[Canada
Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), the
skirmishes will give voters a preview of debates they will hear over the next
seven months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama and his fellow Democrats are arguing
that raising taxes on the rich will help reduce deficits and bring more
fairness to the tax code. Congressional Republicans are pushing a much
different narrative of tax cuts - even if they add to deficits - as a way of
creating jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Americans scurry to file tax returns by
Tuesday, the Senate on Monday evening will debate legislation known as the
Buffett Rule, which would require households earning more than $1 million to
pay at least a 30-percent tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to Obama's "tax
fairness" re-election campaign theme, the rule is named after billionaire
Warren Buffett, who supports it and famously complains that he pays a lower
effective tax rate than his secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solidly opposed by
Republicans who argue raising taxes will hurt the fragile economy, the Buffett
Rule bill being offered by Democrats is not expected to clear a procedural
vote in the Senate on Monday,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), when 60 out of 100 votes would be
needed. Democrats hold only a slim majority in the
chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think it is an important message for
Washington to send to middle-class Americans," said Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), a Democrat sponsoring the
legislation. "Even if we come up short, we'll keep pushing this issue all year
long."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLASS WARFARE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans say the
measure will do nothing to solve the larger problem of deficits and
unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a president that seems more
interested in pitting people against each other than he is in doing anything,"
said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was
hitting on a Republican theme that raising taxes on the rich was tantamount to
class warfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday Republicans - in firm control the
U.S. House of Representatives - are expected to debate and likely approve a
bill to give a one-year, 20-percent tax deduction on business income to owners
of businesses with fewer than 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans are
portraying that tax cut as one for "small businesses," a group they say the
Buffett Rule will harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats say the legislation will
add to already huge budget deficits, since Republicans do not include any
measures to offset the $46 billion revenue loss. And they cite studies showing
that the tax cut will mainly go to those with incomes over $200,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
),000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That measure is not likely to make it through
the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BATTLE ESCALATING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle
over taxes has been escalating for weeks with the White House speaking nearly
daily about the Buffett Rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama campaign played
offense last week by releasing the president's tax returns several days before
the deadline,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
to put pressure on Republican presidential candidate Mitt
Romney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama and his wife paid about 20.5 percent of their
income in taxes in 2011,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), compared to an estimated 15.4
percent rate paid by the Romney's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romney, however, has
asked for an extension to file his taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Gallup poll out
on Monday said that Americans are split fairly evenly between those who say
their federal tax bill is fair and those who say they pay too
much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when asked specifically about how the wealthy are
taxed, about 60 percent back some kind of Buffett Rule, Gallup's surveys have
found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a robust finding across whichever polls that
ask, you usually get 60 percent plus that say, 'yes, higher income are paying
too little,'" Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup polling,
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polling, telephone interviews with about 1,000
adults, has a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Xavier Briand)&lt;/p&gt; PoliticsRelated

##  U.S. accuses China of instigating plot against DuPont

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Federal authorities successfully kept a
U.S. businessman in jail on Wednesday ahead of his trial on charges relating
to trade secret theft, and argued that it was Chinese government
representatives who directed him to obtain valuable technology manufactured by
chemical giant DuPont.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter Liew, a U.S. citizen, and his
wife, Christina Liew, were indicted last year on three counts each, including
witness tampering, making a false statement and conspiracy to tamper with
witnesses and evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now newly released court documents
from prosecutors provide fresh details about Walter Liew's alleged links with
the Chinese government. They name, as one of the Chinese representatives who
met with him, a high-ranking Communist Party official who later became a
member of the Politburo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liew, 54, and his wife have pleaded
not guilty, and he was held without bail and his wife released, court
documents show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), he appeared in a yellow prison jump suit at a San Francisco federal court
hearing where U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathaniel Cousins rejected defense
attempts to obtain his release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liew attorney Thomas Nolan
maintained in court that Liew had only possessed publicly available
information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is nothing at all illegal about that
conduct," Nolan said. "What is illegal is if he uses trade
secrets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liew paid at least two former DuPont engineers for
assistance in designing chloride-route titanium dioxide, also known as
TiO2,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
according to the indictment. DuPont is the world's largest producer of the
white pigment used to make a range of white-tinted products,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), including paper, paint and
plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has identified industrial spying
as a significant and growing threat to the nation's prosperity. In a
government report released last November, authorities cited China as "the
world's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic
espionage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology analyst Mark Anderson, who has spoken
on Chinese trade policy and spying for years,[coach
outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), said he had never seen a member of
the Politburo named in an espionage case before. He said the DuPont case was
all the more remarkable because the main thrust of the case was economic, not
military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is their most valuable trade secret in the
world of paint," he said, noting that the DuPont division in question reported
$6 billion in revenue in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liew was hosted at a banquet
in 1991 by Luo Gan, who at the time was a high-ranking official of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, according to correspondence from
Liew that U.S. federal officials say they seized from his safety deposit box.
Luo Gan went on to become a member of the nine-member Standing Committee of
the Politburo, prosecutors wrote in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several
other Chinese officials also attended, according to the
documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose of the banquet is to thank me for
being a patriotic overseas Chinese who has made contributions to China," Liew
wrote in a memo to a Chinese company,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), according to U.S. prosecutors,
"and who has provided key technologies with national defense applications, in
paint/coating and microwave communications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luo Gan gave
Liew directives at the meeting, and two days later Liew received a list of
"key task projects," including TiO2, prosecutors stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
his court filing seeking bail, Liew denies he was invited to a banquet with
some Chinese officials, but Luo Gan is not discussed. Prosecutors contend that
Chinese companies had not been able to master DuPont's technology on their
own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liew, however, obtained that technology from former
DuPont employees and sold it to companies controlled by the PRC
government,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )," prosecutors
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately
respond to an email seeking comment on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dupont
spokesman Dan Turner said the company referred the matter to law enforcement,
and "will continue to take, aggressive measures to protect its proprietary,
unique, and confidential technologies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuPont also filed a
civil lawsuit against Liew last year, before he was indicted, for
misappropriating trade secrets. The charges Liew now faces grew out of this
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liew denies obtaining or possessing "any confidential,
proprietary trade secret materials" from DuPont regarding TiO2, according to
court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking bail, Liew's attorneys note that
he was born in Malaysia and has lived in the United States for 32
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's request for incarceration ignores
the maxim that "in our society, liberty is the norm," Liew's lawyers
wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cousins said Liew could seek release again if he
could pledge more money for bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California is United States of America vs. Walter
Liew and Christina Liew, 11-cr-573.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by

Europe bond yields to keep stocks spellbound" )]

##  Europe bond yields to keep stocks spellbound

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investors came to the Thanksgiving holiday
table on Thursday mostly thankful that the week was a short one, or losses
could have been larger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As another round of news and bond
auctions from Europe begins next week, traders will watch closely sovereign
bond yields that have kept markets on edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields rose in
almost every euro-zone country this week, and Germany failed to find enough
bids for a 10-year auction. The S&amp;P 500 reacted by posting a second
straight week of declines and its worst week in two
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politicians are scrambling to find a way out of a
two-year-old sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and a visit to Washington
from top European Union officials, as well as a meeting of euro-zone finance
ministers, will provide the market with headlines and possibly add to
uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the specter of rising yields, France,
Britain,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), Italy, Belgium and Spain are
holding debt sales next week. The direction of bond yields will determine the
direction of equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Politicians are trying to buy
themselves time so austerity measures kick in and impact budgets and deficits
and markets become more forgiving and rates come down," said Wasif Latif, vice
president of equity investments at the San Antonio, Texas-based USAA
Investment Management, which manages about $45 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The
credit market and fixed income are a little bit more in the eye of storm;
that's where the issue is rising,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), so
equities are more reactionary," he said. "You may continue to see more of the
same."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have worried about rising borrowing costs
in many euro-zone nations, but Italy, the third-largest euro zone economy, has
grabbed most of the focus. On Friday Rome paid a record 6.5 percent to borrow
for six months and almost 8 percent to issue two-year zero coupon
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many market participants have said that the sharply
differentiated risk-on and -off trades that the euro zone crisis has generated
has seen equities being sold as an asset class, with little or no difference
between strong and week balance sheets and earnings reports. But a wedge has
opened at least from a global perspective, as data show stocks of companies
with more exposure to Europe are underperforming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLITICS
TO DRIVE THE WEEK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama will meet on Monday
with European Council President Herman van Rompuy and European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso, and Europe's response to the two-year sovereign
debt crisis is expected to top the agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only thing
that will come out of that is speculation,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" )," said Todd
Salamone,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), vice president of research at
Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, referring to the meeting in
Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will come down to the U.S. trying to
convince European leaders to get something in place to solve this
crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not many hopes are set either on Tuesday's meeting
where euro-zone finance ministers are expected to agree on how to further
strengthen the region's bailout fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday,[pochette

WILL BE KEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important U.S. economic monthly
data will be released next week, but will it be enough to unlink the stock
market's behavior and European yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New home sales and
the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices index will start the week showing if the

who flooded U.S. stores on Friday as the holiday shopping season started, will

the U.S. number on Wednesday but also factory readings from Europe and China
on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By midweek labor data takes over with the
private sector employment report from ADP and Challenger's job cuts
report,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/

jobless claims numbers and topped by Friday's monthly non-farm payrolls
report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would be a little bit refreshing to focus on the
U.S. data for a change," said Brian Lazorishak, senior quantitative analyst
and portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville,
Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said if European headlines allow it, the focus
will be in the labor market where "most people are looking for modest

##  Halliburton Q3 beats, modest tone weighs on shares

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N),[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the world's second-largest
oilfield services company, posted a higher-than-expected profit, but its stock
reversed Friday's gain due to the less exuberant outlook of its
management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Dave Lesar talked of the risk
of decreased U.S. gas-directed drilling, and expected some rigs to be
redeployed to liquids-rich regions, though he also noted such shifts can weigh
on efficiency and financial performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurt Hallead,
analyst at RBC Capital Markets, pointed to the executives' discussion of flat
international pricing against seasonal weakness in North America as indicating
fourth-quarter profit estimates would need to be trimmed from the current
average of $1.03 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton's profit surge in
the past year has been driven by the need for drillers to tap its hydraulic
fracturing expertise to extract oil and gas from U.S. shale
rock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bear case mentality is that U.S. fracking has
peaked," Hallead said of what investors had to consider when buying the stock
at this point in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a rally on Friday,
Halliburton shares fell as much as 7.8 percent on Monday, despite another
strong quarterly performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net profit rose
to $683 million, or 74 cents per share, from $544 million or 60 cents per
share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Halliburton earned 94 cents
per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 92 cents, according to
Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 40 percent to $6.55
billion. Analysts had expected $6.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts
expect the North American shale boom to last at least through 2012, even with
the weak American economy,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), as producers plow billions of dollars into developing U.S. oil shale
fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesar said Halliburton expects to have hired 17,000
people this year, including 12,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ),000 in the United States,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), implying an increase
in its worldwide headcount to about 77,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While
acknowledging some clients may cut back on spending, Lesar warned against
comparisons with the drilling downturn of 2008. He cited the emergence of new
U.S. oil resources, easy access to capital, the higher number of large
customers in U.S. land drilling, improved contracts and equipment
shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these factors provide me with continued
confidence in the resiliency of the North American market,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" )," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays in operations
in Iraq and an operational shutdown in Libya hurt third-quarter results,
though Halliburton said profit from operations outside the United States
"recovered at the rate we expected" during the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three rigs did start operating in Iraq toward the
end of the quarter. In Libya,[moncler

"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), where rebels have ousted ruler
Muammar Gaddafi, the company is assessing whether to
reopen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton has put behind it a major liability
attached to former unit KBR Inc (KBR.N), which just settled a five-year
dispute over failed bolts on subsea oilfield flow lines off Brazil for $200
million. The company took a $163 million related charge in the third
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton shares were down 7.1 percent at $34.79
on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning, off an earlier low at
$34.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder in New York and Braden

Analysis  IMF funds drive caught in global power shift" )]

##  Analysis IMF funds drive caught in global power shift

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tensions among some of the world's leading
economies are on a boil over a plan to raise new resources for the
International Monetary Fund to contain the euro zone debt crisis and a quest
by emerging economies to win more say in the global lender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World finance leaders gathering in Washington next week will focus on
proposals for countries to contribute more money to the IMF so it is better
prepared in case of a fallout from any further escalation of Europe's debt
crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging market countries like China, Brazil and
Russia are willing to put up more money for the IMF but they want something in
return: greater voting power in the global lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has
become a hot-button issue given negotiations formally began this week on the
next phase of IMF voting reforms to be completed in 2013. The emerging market
push likely means Europe's voting share will be further
diluted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the IMF said it would need $600
billion in new resources to help "innocent bystanders" who might be affected
by economic and financial spillovers from Europe's
travails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, IMF Managing Director Christine
Lagarde said the lender may not need as much money as it had thought because
economic risks had waned. On Friday officials from the Group of 20 nations
told Reuters the world's major economies are likely to agree to provide the
IMF somewhere between $400 billion and $500 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A G20
official, who requested anonymity, said the fundraising effort would likely
raise about $50 billion from Japan and a similar amount from China and Saudi
Arabia,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"
), in addition to the $200 billion already committed by Europe. Smaller
amounts will likely come from countries such as Russia, Mexico and
Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUDGET POLITICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMF funding will
be discussed by the Group of Seven wealthy nations on April 19, jointly by the
G20 and G7 that evening,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), and at a lunch the following day
among the G20 and the Fund's steering committee, G20 sources
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde said she hoped to make progress on the issue
at next week's meetings but said an agreement could take
time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G20 sources said Beijing was being cautious given
internal opposition against providing money for wealthy Europeans, even though
the funds are meant to protect non-European
nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with other emerging economies like Brazil
and India, Beijing wants any funding commitment eventually tied to greater IMF
voting power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, which is heading into a
presidential election in which its hefty budget deficits are a key topic, has
insisted it will not be part of the fundraising effort for the IMF. Canada is
also unlikely to give money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials say they are
already helping Europe by providing dollar swap lines to the European Central
Bank to ease dollar funding strains among European
institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some senior IMF officials say not having
Washington participate has changed the dynamic of the fundraising effort since
the United States is the largest IMF shareholder and its leadership is often
sought on such issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMF sources said an agreement on new
IMF resources would likely be postponed until a G20 leaders' summit in
June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Americans have to be part of this, perhaps not
quite as much as they would've been in the past, but through some significant
gesture," said Uri Dadush, director of the International Economics Program at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "They have to be part of the
leadership group that makes it happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWING
FRUSTRATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing frustration among emerging
economies with the slow pace of IMF governance reforms has been exacerbated by
a likely delay of a 2010 agreement on voting reforms, which the United States
pushed for aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reforms included changes in the
make-up of the IMF's 24-member board, in which two chairs occupied by European
countries would go to emerging economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the
package cannot go through until the U.S. Congress approves the move,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), which is highly
unlikely ahead of November elections because it would require authorizing
additional funding for the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2010 reforms would move
China into third place in the ranks of IMF voters, while also increasing the
voting share of Brazil and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paulo Nogueira Batista,
the IMF executive director for Brazil and a constituency of other Latin
American and Caribbean countries, said the United States needed to stick by
its 2010 commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a commitment in the agreement
to undertake best efforts to complete the steps by the annual meetings this
year (in October), and that commitment includes the U.S.," said Nogueira
Batista, speaking in his personal capacity. "I expect them to follow through
with the commitment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The problem is that the economic and
political difficulties of the advanced economies, mainly the U.S. and euro
area, are having negative spillover effects on international governance," he
said, "They are negatively affecting the G20 and the functioning of the IMF
through delays in the implementation of the agreed
reforms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are frustrations with U.S. delays,
many countries understand the tough political environment the Obama
administration faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new negotiations under way on
voting reforms will initially focus on agreement around a formula for
calculating quotas, or membership subscriptions. The new formula will
influence how members' voting shares are realigned to give emerging and
developing countries more say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domenico Lombardi, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said emerging economies are
using the IMF's push for more resources as leverage to gain even more voting
power in the next round of reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very
political game," said Lombardi,[coach

"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), a former World Bank board director
"What emerging economies are saying is that even if the 2010 reform package is
not approved at least you have to be more lenient and concede more on the
quota formula discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are in a position to exert
the greatest bargaining power they can and extract concessions from the
advanced economies,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/

UnitedHealth to join Dow as only healthcare insurer" )]

##  UnitedHealth to join Dow as only healthcare insurer

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) will replace
Kraft Foods Inc (KFT.O) in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, putting the
nation's largest health insurer in the storied 30-stock index at a time when
an aging U.S. population is making healthcare one of the strongest-growing
segments of the economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth joins pharmaceutical
companies Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck &amp; Co (MRK.N) among the Dow's
healthcare stocks. Insurance is already represented by Travelers Companies Inc
(TRV.N), though UnitedHealth will be the only insurance stock with a
healthcare focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe it is an industry that needs
to be represented in the Dow," said David Blitzer, chairman of the index
committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices in New York. On a conference call,
Blitzer said the absence of a healthcare insurance stock was "something of an
issue" for the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has been volatile in
recent years because of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, and
because of aging U.S. population demographics, which could increase demand for
long-term healthcare options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, it just shows the
sector is gaining the kind of importance and visibility with the Street that
it should be getting," said Ana Gupte,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New York. "I
think it's pretty clear that private-public partnerships are the
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is effective at the close of markets on
September 21, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXCLUSIVE CLUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow industrials
have been in existence since 1896, devised as a way to keep track of overall
trends in the market. These days, the broader S&amp;P 500 Index .INX .SPX is
considered a more accurate barometer of the
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), the Dow's
limited membership of 30 stocks and the infrequent changes in the average make
its composition a popular topic among market
enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth's market cap of more than $55
billion is well below other companies that are seen as popular choices to
become Dow components, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), the most valuable U.S.
company, and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google and Apple are very
popular stocks, but given the way the Dow is calculated as a price-weighted
index, they could potentially distort the Dow and I don't think we would be
doing a service by adding them," said Blitzer, referring to how the price of
each component in the blue-chip average determines its weighting, with the
most expensive shares having more influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Apple and
Google have share prices above $600. International Business Machines (IBM.N),
the fourth-biggest stock in the Dow by market cap, has a weighting of 11.8
percent in the index due to its $200-plus share price, however that will drop
to 11.71 percent after the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealth will have a
weighting of 3.06 percent when it is added, according to Birinyi
Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of UnitedHealth were up 0.1 percent at
$53.93 on Friday afternoon,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), are up 7.9 percent so far this year. Kraft shares
were down 0.5 percent at $39.93.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of Kraft
follows the company's plan to split itself into a snack company called
Mondelez International and a North American grocery business with the Kraft
name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that Mondelez will be significantly smaller
than Kraft and that the majority of Mondelez's revenue will come from outside
the United States,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), Blitzer said that "if a stock is clearly
not eligible to be added, we'll consider removing it,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), especially if we see a better or
more interesting stock that's eligible to go in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kraft's
tenure in the Dow was a short one, as it had been there only since September
2008, when it replaced American International Group Inc (AIG.N) amid the
financial crisis. Food stocks will still be represented in the Dow by Coca-
Cola Co (KO.N) and McDonald's Corp (MCD.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional

Q+A  How does the budget proposal work" )]

##  Q+A How does the budget proposal work

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday submits to
Congress his third annual budget plan, one for the fiscal year 2012 that
begins on October 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the shape of the nation's
finances -- successive years of record budget deficits that have piled onto a
federal debt that many economists deem unmanageable -- this budget proposal is
particularly important to politicians and financial
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is in budgets produced by
presidents and how key are they in determining fiscal
policy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS THE BUDGET?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a
political document that gives the president another forum for unveiling new
policy initiatives, but it is not a single bill that is put up for a vote.
While it's full of numbers, the budget is an opportunity for presidents to
show where they want to take the country over the next few years and how they
will pay the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a budget message introducing last
year's proposal, Obama spoke of the need to improve healthcare and the
environment, which were hot topics all year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT TO WATCH
FOR?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, people will watch whether Obama calls for
major changes to Social Security,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), Medicare
and Medicaid and whether he goes beyond his State of the Union call for $400
billion in savings by freezing many federal programs for five
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another question is whether Obama will formally
embrace some recommendations that his deficit commission submitted last year
to cut spending and raise taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hard times, presidents
can use the budget to try to pep up a dispirited
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's budget message concluded: "These have
been tough times and there will be difficult months ahead. But the storms of
the past are receding; the skies are brightening; and the horizon is beckoning
once more." Fostering optimism is one way presidents get re-
elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT IS IN THE BUDGET?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the
rhetoric in the opening message,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), the thick volumes that make up the
document are filled with economic projections that analysts and financial
markets pore over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration's latest
forecasts of annual budget deficits, economic growth, inflation, debt and
interest rates are embedded, although sometimes these figures can be sugar-
coated to put the administration in the best possible light. Or, projections
might be made to look even worse than expected, making it easier for the
administration to later boast about fantastic progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
budget also can contain programs that the president says he wants to terminate
immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT HAPPENS AFTER CONGRESS RECEIVES OBAMA'S
BUDGET?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a request to Congress for funds to pay for
everything from federal retirement benefits to military programs,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), law enforcement and space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But members of
Congress, especially those not from the president's own political party, often
describe the president's budget this way: "Dead on
arrival."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even some members of the president's own party
have different priorities for spending and
taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, submission of the president's budget
kicks off a series of hearings on Capitol Hill where administration officials
and outside experts offer their views on the programs Obama is
requesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOES THE BUDGET EVER GET ENACTED INTO
LAW?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not quite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After budget committees in
the House of Representatives and Senate wrap up their hearings on the
president's budget,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), they try to produce their own
budget blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the committees succeed,[coach
outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), the full House and full Senate will
vote on those budgets, possibly as early as March or April. But these measures
are called "resolutions," meaning they are not bills that eventually get sent
to the president for signing into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THEN WHY BOTHER
PASSING A BUDGET RESOLUTION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These resolutions are important
because if passed by Congress, they provide marching instructions to other
committees, which then try to write legislation that can be enacted into
law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the appropriations committees get their budget
instructions, they will try to write a dozen separate bills to fund programs.
It's as if the budget committees set up checking accounts and the
appropriations committees write the checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans who
control the House want the FY12 budget resolution to require steep spending
cuts. But some are concerned that if Obama is presented with spending bills
that are too austere, there could be a deadlock that could even lead to
government shutdowns toward the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax-
writing committees in Congress also play an important role in trying to
implement new tax cuts or tax increases called for in a budget
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOW DOES THE DEBT LIMIT FIT INTO ALL OF
THIS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department has told Congress that between
early April and late May the government could bump up against a $14.3 trillion
statutory limit on borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration wants
Congress to quickly raise the limit. Failure to do so, it warns, could force
the government to default on loans which could spark a global financial
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Republicans want to include language in a debt
limit bill tying it to the budget resolution, and want a budget resolution
with spending cuts that they know Obama wouldn't swallow. Senate Democrats
likely will work to change whatever budget the House passes,[sacs Louis
Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), but there are worries that a
congressional budget blueprint with too many spending cuts could prompt Obama
to veto a debt limit bill. It's a highly unlikely scenario, but one that could
rattle markets in coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sandra

Oil falls in low volume as Libyan rebels gain ground" )]

##  Oil falls in low volume as Libyan rebels gain ground

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude fell on Monday for a third day in the
lowest trading volume of the year, as Libyan rebels regained key territory and
redoubled efforts to resume oil exports from the OPEC country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil seesawed during the day on a weakening U.S. dollar .DXY , upbeat
U.S. pending home sales data, and growing speculation that the European
Central Bank will raise interest rates as early as next month, which helped
bolster the euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures for May delivery
settled down 79 cents at $114.80 a barrel. U.S. May crude futures fell for a
third day,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), losing $1.42 to
$103.98.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent's premium to the U.S. benchmark increased by
40 cents to $10.82 a barrel, within a recently established range,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), after narrowing from a March 1 record above
$17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most notable aspect of oil trade was its low
volume, with uncertainty running high due to Middle East unrest, a nuclear
crisis in quake-hit Japan, unsure economic prospects for the euro zone, and
U.S. Federal Reserve officials debating quantitative easing
policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total U.S. crude volume was 58 percent below the
30-day average. At 348,370 lots traded by the end of regular NYMEX market
hours, volume was on pace to be the lowest since December 31, according to
Reuters data. Brent trading volume was 48 percent below the 30-day
average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The low trading volumes have continued from last
week with a high level of indecision in oil markets," said John Kilduff of New
York hedge fund Again Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Uncertainty about supplies
from the Middle East is counterbalanced with the potential for demand
destruction in Japan following the earthquake. The big momentum players are
getting sidelined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIBYAN REBELS GAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
OPEC producer Libya,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), rebels backed by Western air strikes advanced
their position over the weekend,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), regaining control of key oil
ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could help slowly revive exports from the North
African oil producer, whose oil shipments have been slashed to a fraction of
their usual 1.5 million barrels a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Treasury
official said rebels could sell Libyan crude free from sanctions imposed
against transactions with the government of Colonel Muammar
Gaddafi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle East Gulf country Qatar, which has backed
the Libyan rebels, agreed to help sell the Libyan
crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebel leaders, oil traders and analysts said the
developments raised the possibility of more oil exports, but warned they did
not expect quick resumption of large volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing
fighting and concerns over U.S. and United Nations sanctions are likely to
keep crimping Libya's output, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Qatar's help and
rebel gains in theory could quicken Libya's efforts to resume oil shipments,
but there are still a lot of logistics problems," said Matt Smith of Summit
Energy in Louisville, Kentucky..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of the workers that
operate Libya's oil industry have left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Arab
Emirates said it has "stepped in" to help make up for lost output from Libya,
and acknowledged that other OPEC producers have done the same by unilaterally
boosting output, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
Angola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. National Association of Realtors said its
Pending Home Sales Index,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), based on contracts signed in
February,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), unexpectedly rose 2.1 percent,
potentially boosting the outlook a U.S. economic
recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Japan's woes and Europe's murky economic
outlook have dampened bullishness about growth in oil
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Europe remains a concern with Portugal, Ireland and
Greece all contributing to a negative economic picture," Smith
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve officials are sending
differing signals about whether the central bank should continue quantitative
easing as U.S. consumer prices edge higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta Fed
President Dennis Lockhart said the easing policy is "appropriately calibrated"
to the state of the U.S. economy. Over the weekend, St. Louis Fed President
James Bullard said policymakers should consider discontinuing quantitative
easing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Robert Gibbons in New York,

Netherlands political crisis casts cloud on euro zone" )]

##  Netherlands political crisis casts cloud on euro zone

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands, a core euro zone member, was
drawn into Europe's debt crisis at the weekend when the government failed to
agree on budget cuts, making elections almost unavoidable and casting doubt on
its support for future euro zone measures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister
Mark Rutte, whose centre-right coalition has been in power since October 2010,
said on Saturday that crucial talks on budget cuts had collapsed after his
ally Geert Wilders refused to do a deal, and that new elections were
inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, the government must seek
support for budget cuts from the opposition parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
uncertainty over the makeup of a new government, and waning voter support for
bailouts and austerity measures, raised questions over Dutch backing for a
fiscal responsibility pact seen as crucial to helping Europe cope with its
debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The catalyst for the crisis was Wilders, who
refused to agree to 14-to-16 billion euros ($18.5-$21.1 billion) of budget
cuts needed to bring a bloated budget deficit under
control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the euro-skeptic, anti-immigration politician
has threatened to fight his campaign on a European
battleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Freedom Party benches are unanimously
against Brussels diktats and the attack on our elderly," Wilders tweeted on
Sunday, later telling Dutch news agency ANP that Europe would be in "sharp
focus" during any coming election campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilders most
recently has lobbied to jettison the euro and return to the guilder, the old
Dutch currency, and he is against immigration not only of Muslims but also of
Poles and other central and eastern European members of the EU - views that
strike a chord with his supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Freedom Party had a
pact to support Rutte's minority government in parliament, giving it the
majority to pass legislation, but after seven weeks of budget talks, Wilders
suddenly backed out just when a deal appeared close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His
supporters are against budget cuts, particularly cuts in welfare, health and
unemployment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a package that would damage
our economy over coming years and increase unemployment. And all that to meet
a demand made by Brussels, accepted by the Liberals, of reaching a 3 percent
deficit in 2013," he said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRAGMENTED POLITICAL
FIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An opinion poll published on Sunday showed the
Netherlands remains highly fragmented politically, suggesting that it could
prove difficult to form a new coalition quickly and that Wilders's chances of
forming a new government were slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maurice de Hond
poll, conducted after the budget talks collapsed, showed that no single party
would have a majority if elections were held now,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), though Rutte's Liberal Party has
strengthened its lead, followed closely by two leftist
parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll also showed that a majority favor smaller
budget cuts than those stipulated by the European Union,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), a further sign that the
notoriously frugal Dutch are suffering from "bailout fatigue" and resent the
high cost of rescuing profligate peripheral euro zone
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Voters from different parties share the same
view - disgust or disappointment over the political action and the political
parties," De Hond said in a statement, adding that two thirds of those polled
agreed with the statement: "I'm tired of all the party
politics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether the Netherlands should cut less
than the European Union wants, 57 percent of respondents agreed. Supporters of
the populist Freedom Party and of the leftist Socialist Party were
particularly set against cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poll showed the Dutch
were most strongly opposed to spending cuts that would have a direct impact on
standards of living, 56 percent of respondents opposing the introduction of a
new, modest prescription charge, and 47 percent opposing an increase in value
added tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cabinet is set to meet on Monday to discuss
what it should do next to agree a budget and whether to resign. The Queen
could accept its resignation,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), paving the way for elections, or ask the prime minister to form a new
coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If elections are called, Rutte's Liberals would
win 33 seats in the 150-seat parliament,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), up from 31 now, the poll showed,
followed by the eurosceptic Socialist Party with 30 seats and the pro-Europe
Labour Party with 24 seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutte's coalition partner, the
Christian Democrats, and the Freedom Party, until Saturday his main ally, have
both slipped in the polls and would win 11 and 19 seats
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUDGET SINNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutte and
Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager - who flew back from IMF talks in
Washington when the crisis broke - are among the euro zone's harshest critics
of "budget sinners" like Greece and Portugal, and the Netherlands is seen as
close to Germany in calling for tough austerity
measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The
Netherlands can no longer be a role model to others. There may be a reaction
in other countries: 'If they don't do it, why should we?' This risk exists,
which is unpleasant,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" )," said Jaap Koelewijn, an economist and professor
of corporate finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual budget cuts Wilders has
balked at are needed for the Netherlands to meet European Commission targets.
Without them, its public deficit is forecast to hit 4.6 percent of GDP in
2013, well above the 3 percent agreed with the
Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Netherlands does not cut spending and
breaks EU budget rules, it is likely to lose its coveted triple-A credit
rating, leading to higher borrowing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of
state debt rose to 65.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 from 62.9 percent in
2010, Statistics Netherlands said last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings agency
Fitch recently warned the Netherlands it must get its finances in order or
risk a ratings downgrade,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), while in a report last month, Citibank
went as far as to say it no longer deserved to be considered a core member of
the euro zone because of its fiscal woes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty
over budget cuts and reforms, and the time it takes to organize elections,
will probably lead to higher interest rates and higher yields on Dutch
government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost of finance for the Netherlands
will go up slightly compared to Germany, but our debt is mostly long-term. The
Netherlands doesn't have high refinancing needs in the next few years," said
economist Sweder van Wijnbergen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7571

Insight  ECB preparing to close liquidity floodgates" )]

##  Insight ECB preparing to close liquidity floodgates

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Central Bank wants its
second offer of cheap ultra-long funds next week to be its last, putting the
onus back on governments to secure the euro zone's longer-term
future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Powerful members of the central bank's 23-man
governing council are privately hoping demand at the February 29 auction will
fall well short of the 1 trillion euros some expect, backing their view that
it should be the last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bank sources say they are
worried that banks will become too reliant on ECB funds,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), removing the incentive to restart lending between
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB first offered banks low cost three-year
money in December to stave off a freeze in interbank lending that threatened
to make the region's debt crisis much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks flocked
to take advantage of the offer, filling their coffers, and ECB President Mario
Draghi said "a major, major credit crunch" had been
averted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some European officials have been hoping the
central bank would carry on supporting the economy with a series of subsequent
cheap money auctions, known as LTROs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ECB wants to
keep pressure on governments to improve their defense of the euro zone with
better economic policies and by bolstering their European Stability Mechanism
(ESM) firewall which will come into being by mid-
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making hundreds of billions of euros easily available
to banks over a three-year period also risks fuelling a credit binge that some
central bankers worry could push up inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB
funneled banks nearly half a trillion euros in cash at the first operation on
December 21. A Reuters poll of over 60 economists showed a mid-range
expectation for it to allot another 492 billion euros next week with some
expecting up to a trillion to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOO
GENEROUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first LTRO, or longer-term refinancing
operation, has already eased market pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrowing
costs for Italy and Spain - at the epicenter of the crisis last year - have
fallen, while parts of the interbank lending market have reopened and stock
markets have rallied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 15 out of 63 analysts polled by
Reuters said banks would bid in the second auction because they needed the
cash to shore up their own balance sheets. But with the money costing just one
percent,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), bid they
will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECB officials accept they have to help the banking
sector but they also want to send a message that the unprecedented liquidity
provision will end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann has
warned that "too generous" supply of liquidity could create risky incentives
for banks, which could in turn store up future inflation
risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of Finland chief Erkki Liikanen is also worried
about ample liquidity provision leading to future problems and has said the
ECB must think about how to unwind the extraordinary measures. Other senior
policymakers are concerned too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SARKOZY
TRADE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If banks used the first LTRO to plug their funding
needs and fend off a credit crunch, ECB officials hope they could use the
second more aggressively to buy higher-yielding bonds, especially from
Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggests banks in Spain used the
first LTRO to make most use of this "Sarkozy trade" - a term adopted by
markets after the French president suggested governments look to banks that
tapped the ECB operation to buy their bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy faces a
debt issuance hump in the next few months and could do with the second LTRO
fuelling demand for its debt. It needs to sell around 45 billion euros of its
bonds a month in both March and April versus 19 billion in
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fitzgerald of the Economic and Social
Research Institute, a Dublin-based think tank, said further long-term funding
from the ECB beyond February may not be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once
they have got Spain and Italy over the line in terms of refinancing needs,
with much of this refinancing set to be done by March,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), the need for the
LTRO may well disappear," said Fitzgerald,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), who also sits on the Irish central bank's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ECB
will be able to breath a sigh of relief. It appears this mechanism was enough
to turn the markets and that the risk of a collapse in the system is less
today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ECB officials expect the second LTRO to give a
boost to lending as well as bond-buying, they are nonetheless worried about
banks becoming dependent on the ECB or heightened liquidity provision leading
to irresponsible banking decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some at the ECB believe
banks should now be redoubling their efforts to raise fresh capital, as
UniCredit recently did through its rights issue, and fear the ECB's help will
create zombie banks reliant on central bank support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB
is also concerned the interbank market is not yet functioning fully. Bankers
themselves see this concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are flooding the market
with cheap refinancing then there comes a point when you are preventing the
market from working because nobody is going to borrow from another bank at X
percent if they can borrow from the ECB at Y percent,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" )," said a senior
banker at a leading global bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB expects governments
to take responsibility for banks that prove too weak to help with extra
liquidity and believes states should step in if, in three years when the
funding term comes to an end, they are incapable of repaying the
credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while governments have made progress dealing
with budgets,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), growth and economic governance,
the ECB wants them to bolster the firewall provided by the EFSF and ESM
bailout funds and is looking for progress at a March 1-2 meeting of
leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This puts the onus squarely on governments, led by
euro zone paymaster Germany, to respond to the debt crisis once the ECB has
unleashed its second three-year lending operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may
come as something of a shock to some banks and officials. One senior EU
official said he had expected the ECB would offer banks a third round of long-
term funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expected a third," he said. "They (ECB)
have always said they will keep an eye on how the market is evolving. My guess
is that they are hedging their bets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Paul

##  Geithner denies U.S. hostility to banks

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner sought to calm fears that the Obama administration's bank reforms
were hostile to the U.S. financial industry, saying on Wednesday the reforms
were "tough where they need to be tough."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I know that
people are concerned that they will be too tough. I don't think there is much
risk of this. I think there is no evidence of that,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" )," Geithner told the
Charlotte Chamber of Commerce one day after President Barack Obama used his
State of the Union address to toughen his stance on Wall
Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury, the Federal Reserve and other
financial supervisors are feverishly adopting dozens of rules to reorder Wall
Street after the 2007-09 housing crisis exposed gaps in regulation. The
administration and its regulators have been repeatedly criticized by
Republican lawmakers for over-reaching with the new
rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a question,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), Geithner said it "wasn't true"
that the administration was hostile to the banking world, while also noting
that some in the United States feel it has been "too generous" to
bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They cannot both be right,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), and they are both wrong," Geithner
said after touring a Siemens plant that manufactures steam turbines and
generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of the financial system was a hot
topic in Charlotte, a city that saw its two big banks nearly collapse in the
financial crisis. Wachovia Corp sold itself to San Francisco-based Wells Fargo
&amp; Co under duress in 2008,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), and Bank of America Corp is still struggling to
shed mortgage-related losses and meet new capital rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
unemployment rate in North Carolina is 9.9 percent, which is above the
national average of 8.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner, asked if the
United States was heading toward another recession, said the economy was
getting stronger in comparison to where it was in 2009 when the country was
"falling off the cliff." "We are still living with the tremendous damage
caused by the crisis,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner,
who had helped the previous Bush administration respond to the financial
crisis when he was the head of the New York Federal Reserve, plans to leave
Treasury's chief job at the end of Obama's first term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an
interview later with Bloomberg, Geithner said he did not expect to be asked to
serve as secretary if Obama won a second term as
president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner reiterated that Europe's deteriorating
debt crisis was taking a toll on the fragile U.S. economy. "This crisis is
having a big impact on us,[pochette louis

Monetary Fund warned that the European Union's debt problems could tip the
world economy into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner has already made

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian coal workers voted on Saturday to strike
over pay and working conditions at the 3-million-tonne-per-year La Jagua mine
of Glencore's (GLEN.L) Prodeco unit, a union said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colombia
is the world's fourth-largest coal exporter and Glencore's La Jagua - one of
the mining concessions it owns in the nation - has some of the country's
highest quality coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 40 days of negotiations with
Prodeco,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), laborers voted unanimously to
strike after the company failed to meet their demands over pay and improved
working conditions, said Ricardo Machado of the Sintraminergetica
union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers have 10 days to act on the strike vote but
they cannot legally walk off the job for the first two days or the last two
days of the period. If they do not carry out a strike during the allotted
time, they must vote again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were relatively close to a
deal but it couldn't be reached. On Monday, we'll continue negotiating with
the company,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )," Machado told Reuters by
telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussions involved workers at Carbones de
La Jagua - one of five concessions that Glencore owns in the northern Cesar
province - and Prodeco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unions use the threat of strikes for
leverage in bargaining talks with mining and oil companies, which have been
returning to Colombia after a fall in guerrilla violence over the last decade
due to a U.S.-backed military offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any walkout would
unlikely affect prices unless it drags on for several weeks, but the industry
is watching closely because the quality of coal that the mine produces is in
relatively tight supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, laborers at La Jagua went
on strike for five weeks before signing a two-year deal,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), and last year, they
struck for eight days at the 5-million-metric tonne-per-year (5.51 million
ton) Calenturitas mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodeco is Colombia's third largest
coal exporter behind Drummond and Cerrejon,[pochette louis

GE Capital CEO says European risks  manageable" )]

##  GE Capital CEO says European risks manageable

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - General Electric Co's (GE.N) finance arm expects Europe's
financial woes to take a toll on its profitability but regards the risk as
"manageable," the unit's head, Michael Neal, told an investor conference on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If trends continue - and there is no reason to
think they won't - in Europe, we will come under some pressure. We think it's
manageable," the chief executive of GE Capital said. "We thought Europe was
going to be this bad, and we weren't disappointed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE
Capital's business in Europe is largely focused on the United
Kingdom,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), France and Germany, which have been
relatively healthier financially than southern European
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that 85 percent of the company's loans
in Europe are secured by property, such as trucks, machine tools or
aircraft,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ),
which can be resold in case the borrower defaults on the
loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We repossess," Neal said. "It's not like we're
writing off a bond."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DIVIDEND PLANS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE
Capital, which earlier this month won the approval of its regulator, the
Federal Reserve, to resume paying a share of its profit back to its parent
company, could return some $20 billion to GE over the next few years, Neal
noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His boss,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), GE's CEO Jeff Immelt, told
investors last week that the company intends to use much of the money GE
Capital pays back to GE, the largest U.S. conglomerate,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), to buy back its
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE's stock rose 9 cents at $19.13 in late afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neal also elaborated
on the company's decision to further cut back its reliance on commercial paper
to about $25 billion from $43 billion at the end of the first quarter and $105
billion in early 2008 before the financial crisis, saying the move was
intended to protect it from potential future problems in that
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think there's any issue with it right now,"
Neal said. "99.9 percent of days, there's no issue with that. It's that you
have to build your strategy around that one bad day that's out there. We've
learned our lesson."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial paper market,[coach

##  Government sues AT&amp;T over fees from misuse of deaf service

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The government charged AT&amp;T Inc (T.N) with cheating
it out of millions of dollars by knowingly failing to prevent swindlers from
using a subsidized telephone service meant for deaf people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said on Thursday it accused AT&amp;T of
billing for reimbursement of calls placed by ineligible international callers
who used the service for purposes such as buying goods from merchants using
stolen credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a filing Wednesday in federal court
in Pennsylvania, the Justice Department joined a whistleblower suit filed by a
former worker at one of AT&amp;T's call centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deaf
and hard-of-hearing in the United States are offered a service at no charge to
place calls to hearing individuals through text messages over the Internet
that are relayed by employees of a so-called IP Relay
provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These providers,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), including AT&amp;T, are reimbursed about $1.30
per minute by the Federal Communications Commission through a fund paid for by
fees added to consumers' telephone bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T contends
that it did not know foreign callers were using the system, and said it has
followed the FCC's rules for providing the service and seeking
reimbursement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the FCC is aware,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), it is always possible for an
individual to misuse IP Relay services, just as someone can misuse the postal
system or an email account,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), but FCC rules require that we
complete all calls by customers who identify themselves as disabled,[sacs

"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )," said Marty Richter,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ), an AT&amp;T
representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Justice Department accused AT&amp;T
of knowingly trying to skirt a 2009 FCC requirement mandating IP Relay
providers verify registered users' name and mailing address. It said foreign
callers accounted for up to 95 percent of call volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
government further alleges that AT&amp;T implemented a registration system
that did not ensure users were in the United States "out of fears that
fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration
deadline."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taxpayers must not bear the cost of abuses of
the Telecommunications Relay system," said David J. Hickton, U.S. Attorney for
the Western District of Pennsylvania. "Those who misuse funds intended to
benefit the hearing- and speech-impaired must be held
accountable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constance Lyttle, a former communications
assistant in an AT&amp;T IP Relay call center, filed the original lawsuit

Pre-summit document presses EU banking union" )]

##  Pre-summit document presses EU banking union

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European leaders will discuss specific steps
towards a cross-border banking union, closer fiscal integration and the
possibility of a debt redemption fund at a summit on June 28-29, according to
a document prepared for the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two officials familiar
with the 10-15 page document, drawn up over the past month and which is still
being revised ahead of the summit, said it sets out in detail the four
"pillars" required for a strong economic and monetary union which leaders
believe is necessary to secure the currency project's
future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as progress towards a banking union, the
paper discusses the need for a more integrated budget policy, steps required
for deeper economic integration, and how to retain "democratic legitimacy" if
countries give up some sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document has been
drafted by European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, European Council
President Herman Van Rompuy, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, and
Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the Eurogroup countries using the
euro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European leaders have already said the first area they
need to work on is a banking integration as they try to break the link between
bad banks and indebted governments, with the worsening situation in Spain an
immediate concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU officials believe that could be
achieved in a year, although Berlin wants to see much more progress towards
fiscal integration first, something that would require much longer due to the
need to change the European Union treaty to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
document goes into most detail on the banking proposals, setting out the need
for a single European banking supervisor, a common EU deposit-guarantee scheme
and a single bank-resolution fund to wind down the region's bad banks, the
officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper sets out options under each
heading, saying that when it comes to a single banking supervisor it could
either be charged with overseeing all EU banks, or else look after the major
systemic banks with cross-border operations, while another body looks after
broader, day-to-day oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expectation is the ECB
will eventually be given sole responsibility for overseeing Europe's biggest
banks, while the European Banking Authority watchdog retains a broader
oversight role along with coordinating the work of national
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a common deposit insurance mechanism, the
paper suggests that there needs to be a strengthening of and closer
integration among national guarantee schemes to provide a more reassuring
backstop across the whole European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a resolution
fund to deal with failing banks, it calls for a single mechanism "with a large
envelope" that would be financed via levies on the banking sector, such as a
financial transaction tax,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), and would offer "an integrated EU solution for
resolution".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), which draws heavily on proposals made by the European Commission on June 6,
says an "immediate and permanent mutualisation" of risk may be required to
backstop the banking sector. It suggests the euro zone's permanent ESM bailout
fund could be used to recapitalize banks directly, rather than having to lend
to governments for on-lending to banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of those
proposals would be possible under existing EU treaties and could be
implemented relatively rapidly, the document indicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even
if it took only a year, this will probably not come quick enough to ease
market pressure on Spain and Italy that is now reaching danger levels,
although some analysts believe a strong signal of intent could help. That
could also persuade the ECB to step in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short term, there
is clearly a risk that the summit will disappoint markets yet again. If that
were to be the case, I have no doubt that the ECB will step in," said Erik
Neilsen, global chief economist at Unicredit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could
take the form of an interest rate cut, further easing of collateral rules for
Spanish banks so they can continue to access ECB funds or even a resumption of
the bank's bond-buying program, which several of its policymakers oppose, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUDGET INTEGRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second
section examining the steps required for closer fiscal coordination, the
document says there is a need to go beyond existing legislative proposals such
as the fiscal treaty, which 25 of the EU's 27 countries have signed up to and
which commits them to a balanced budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper says that
as closer banking and fiscal integration is achieved, the issue of
mutualisation of debt will become more immediate and it raises the option of a
debt redemption fund along the lines of that proposed by Germany's "wise
men".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is an idea that France, Italy and others have
pushed hard for but which German Chancellor Angela Merkel
opposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merkel has not ruled out a sharing of debt per se,
but has said any discussion on it can only happen at the end of a long process
of integration that is likely to take many years. In contrast, France will
find it difficult to stomach the loss of sovereignty that fiscal union would
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The political leaders are now trying to move to a
degree of fiscal and political union within a very short period of time. In
democracies, such changes usually take a few years, and whether enough can be
achieved in time remains to be seen,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )," Neilsen
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, in my mind,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ), this does not imply
an imminent risk of a breakdown of the euro zone ... It's a political project,
and political leaders are unlikely to throw in the towel because markets don't
like the policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sections of the document discuss
the broader aims of greater EU labor mobility,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), efforts to improve
pan-EU competitiveness,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), and to examine common taxation such
as a common corporate tax base and a financial transactions
levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is likely to be heated discussion on issues such
as debt mutualisation and any pooling of liability under a banking union, with
Germany adamant that it will not be put on the line to underwrite the
liabilities of other euro zone countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No decisions are
expected at the summit, but if leaders agree that there are grounds to push
ahead, Barroso, Van Rompuy and the others will be given a further mandate to
develop the ideas in greater detail, including more specific
timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Rompuy has said he hopes to have a more
thorough set of plans drawn up by the next EU leaders' summit in October or
possibly the one after in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Luke Baker;

Stocks slip, dollar up as Irish bailout joy fades" )]

##  Stocks slip, dollar up as Irish bailout joy fades

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks fell and the greenback rose as
investors' optimism about Ireland's 85-billion-euro ($115 billion) debt
bailout waned, exposing the unappetizing prospect that Europe's fiscal
problems will linger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasuries benefited from both
the concerns about Europe's financial health as well as from bond purchases by
the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its quantitative easing
program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Share prices in Tokyo are poised to open higher,
extending Monday's five-month closing high. Nikkei futures in Chicago are up
40 points at 10,105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro hit a two-month nadir against
the greenback, cutting back gold's gains for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
U.S. crude oil futures rebounded, rallying more than 2 percent to settle above
$85 a barrel, as a rally in gasoline and heating oil futures -- plus tensions
in the Korean peninsula -- helped spur demand for
crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence of promising U.S. consumer spending for the
end-of-year holiday shopping season is providing little counterweight so far.
Retail stocks had moved higher in anticipation of the weekend sales, which
were better than expected. So on Monday, investors took some profits in the
retail sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tell me what the euro's going to do and I'll
tell you where the (stock) market is going to go," said Michael James, senior
trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los
Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI
fell 39.51 points,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), or 0.36 percent,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), to 11,052.49. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 1.64 points, or
0.14 percent, to 1,187.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 9.34
points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ),525.22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. bank and energy
stocks outperformed the wider market. The KBW bank index rose 1.1
percent,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
helped by Bank of America (BAC.N), which climbed 1.5 percent to
$11.31,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France and Germany hailed Sunday's Irish bailout as
a rescue of the euro and set a course for a permanent debt resolution
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rescue package was designed both to help Ireland
and to stop a rolling crisis from moving on to Portugal and, perhaps,
Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spreads between Spanish and Italian bonds versus
their German equivalent widened to euro-lifetime highs as optimism for the
Irish deal waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit default swap costs on Portugal and
Spain both hit record highs on Monday on fears that they may be next in line
to struggle with their debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares closed at
nearly an eight-week low, with banks among the casualties. The FTSEurofirst
300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares slid 1.6 percent to end at 1,069.24.
The STOXX 600 banking index .SX7P fell 1.29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's
Nikkei benchmark index .N225 closed on Monday at a five-month high. MSCI'S
All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.68
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURO SLUMPS, TREASURIES RISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
euro's respite was brief in the early hours of Monday's global trading day.
The deal for Ireland, endorsed by the EU finance ministers, also includes
provisions that could make private bondholders share the burden of
restructuring sovereign debt after 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After rising to
$1.3302, one euro bought $1.3132 -- or 0.88 percent less than what could be
exchanged on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect further losses in the
euro,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html
"http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), given the uncertainty
surrounding the fiscal outlook of the region's peripheral countries. The next
key target is $1.30 after the euro fell below the 200-day moving average
around $1.3130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a real possibility the euro could
hit $1.30 by the end of the week," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at
Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the
momentum already in place, the euro will likely be between $1.29 and 1.32 at
the end of the year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose 0.60 percent
to 80.836 against a basket of major trading-partner currencies
.DXY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greenback rose 0.17 percent to 84.24
yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 12/32 of
a point in price, pushing the yield down to 2.828
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sentiment remained fragile, with a sale of Italian
bonds meeting lukewarm demand and highlighting investors' unease about euro-
zone debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irish bond yields reversed an early fall to end
the day higher at 9.6 percent and on course to complete the largest monthly
rise since at least 1992, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
rising likelihood that Portugal and possibly other euro zone states will
require expensive bailouts and increase the burden on Germany, hit Bund
futures which settled 28 ticks lower at 127.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.
December gold futures rose $3.60 to settle at $1,366 an
ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil for January delivery added $1.97, or
2.35percent, to settle at $85.73 a barrel, not far below its intraday
high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting and writing by Daniel Bases; Additional

##  Instant view Euro zone March Retail sales fall

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - Euro zone retail sales fell sharply in
March,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
pointing to weaker household demand, but sales in February were revised
upwards,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"
), data showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ECONOMISTS'
COMMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARSTEN BRZESKI, ECONOMIST AT
ING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are weakish and there is the regional
divergence between the core countries where labor markets are improving and
the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bigger picture level -- first quarter
GDP growth should be good, but the recovery remains mainly industry-driven and
not broadly based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retail sales now would be slightly down
on the quarter, but then retail sales are the most volatile numbers, and are
often revised more than once, so we should take them with a pinch of
salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weakness in private consumption does not come as a
surprise if you see that inflation has been picking up -- energy prices and
food prices -- consumers are the first to feel that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the
data will not have any impact on ECB monetary policy-- if anything, the
numbers would point to a deflationary impact from the higher food prices an
energy, but this was known already last month and the month before and the ECB
still started its tightening cycle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOWARD ARCHER,
ECONOMIST AT IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even allowing for the fact
that retail sales were likely dragged down in March by the later Easter in
2011, the drop is disappointing given the importance of consumer spending to
growth prospects and the fact that it has been fragile through the euro zone's
recovery so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the euro zone is to see
sustained,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), decent growth in 2011, it needs
consumers to increasingly step up to the plate. And worryingly, euro zone
consumer confidence fell for a second month running in April,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), to be at a nine month
low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers were more worried about the economic
situation and outlook in April and about their personal financial situations,
although their concerns over jobs eased. Inflation expectations remained high,
but at least stabilized. There was a sharp weakening in the indices relating
to consumers' willingness to make purchases at present (fell to a nine-month
low) and over the next 12-months (to a six-month low).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
problem is that in recent times, it has not taken much for euro zone consumers
to rein back their spending, and they do currently have significant matters to
worry about. On the positive side, euro zone labor markets have shown recent
overall modest improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), purchasing power is being squeezed by rising inflation (euro zone consumer
price inflation was at a 30-month high of 2.8 percent in April) and muted wage
growth, while tighter fiscal policy is increasingly kicking in across the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite the recent modest overall
improvement in labor markets, the euro zone unemployment rate is still
elevated at 9.9 percent and it seems unlikely to fall markedly in the near
term at least. On top of this, many consumers have significant worries about
their long-term financial positions. As a result,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), consumers' propensity to buy is
likely to remain relatively low in many euro zone
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, despite the marked drop in
its retail sales in March, Germany still seems well placed for a significant
pick up in consumer spending in 2011. Consumers in Germany are benefiting from
high and rising employment and higher wage settlements, while it seems likely
that there must be an element of pent-up demand after many years of muted
spending. Having said that German consumers get particularly worried about
inflation so there is still the very real possibility that they will be very
careful in their spending for now at least."&lt;/p&gt;Related Theme Articles:

##  Fed's Fisher sees no need for more monetary easing

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - The economy is in much better shape and does not
need further help from the central bank,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), a top Federal Reserve official known for his hawkish policy views said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although growth is "slower than we would
like,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" )," Dallas
Fed President Richard Fisher told Fox Business Network, "it's gaining
momentum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will not support further quantitative easing
under these circumstances because there's a lot of money lying on the
sidelines, lying fallow," he said according to a transcript provided by the
network. "We don't need any more monetary morphine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed
has kept benchmark interest rates near zero since December 2008 and has bought
$2.3 trillion in bonds to stimulate growth,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), a program known as quantitative
easing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its March policy meeting, the Fed nodded to
recent economic improvement but reiterated concerns about high unemployment
and its expectation that subpar economic performance will require keeping
rates near zero through late 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among analysts and
investors, however,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), expanding manufacturing and
improving labor markets in recent months have lifted hopes for recovery. In
February unemployment was at a three-year low of 8.3 percent. The housing
sector also appears poised to improve, with permits for homebuilding this week
approaching a 3-1/2-year high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders have reacted by
betting the Fed will start raising rates as soon as July
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher, who is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting
panel this year,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), said he is not worried about
inflation, which he expects to come down to around the Fed's 2 percent
target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real problem in our country is job creation and
prosperity,[coach outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" )," he said. "And we need to get better
fiscal policy to complement what we at the Fed have done, because it's not
working as effectively as it should."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rates near zero,
pushing borrowing costs lower simply will not create more jobs, Fisher
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see what more would do," Fisher said. "And I
especially could not justify it if the economy continues to improve along the
path which has been indicated recently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ann

Germany builds core group for transactions tax" )]

##  Germany builds core group for transactions tax

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Germany will work with a core group of
European Union countries on introducing a financial transactions tax, its
finance minister said on Friday, after efforts to get an agreement among all
27 EU countries fell short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said 10 countries were prepared to use an EU process known as
'enhanced cooperation' to push ahead with developing the tax,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ), which Britain and
other states, including some in the euro zone,
oppose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced cooperation requires at least 9 EU
countries to agree to work on a proposal. France, Italy and Spain are all
behind Germany with the initiative, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after
a meeting with her counterparts in Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from such a
tax, which some analysts estimate could raise more than 50 billion euros a
year depending on the number of countries that participate, could be used to
finance initiatives such as a fund to wind down bad
banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My impression is that quite a number of member
states strongly support the proposal of an FTT (Financial Transactions Tax) in
principle," Schaeuble said after a meeting of EU finance ministers in
Luxembourg. "We should give it a try."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denmark, which holds
the rotating presidency of the EU, has tried for months to broker an agreement
on an FTT but acknowledged on Friday that it would not be possible to do it
among all 27 countries given the divisiveness of the
issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What was promising was that a number of countries
expressed interest in going forward with enhanced cooperation," said Margrethe
Vestager, Denmark's minister for economic affairs,[Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), who added that
Schaeuble's mention of 10 countries was about right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If
there are nine, the (European) Commission can come up with a new proposal.
Nine or more countries have expressed interest in enhanced cooperation," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the debate about such a tax has centered on a
blueprint written by the European Commission for a tax on stocks, bonds and
derivatives trades from 2014 that its own research said could raise up to 57
billion euros a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spain's economy minister said his
country stood firmly behind the proposal. "We are determined to start the
enhanced cooperation,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" )," Luis de Guindos told
reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austria also supports the
proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many ministers were critical of the
idea,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), with some signaling that they could
even challenge a smaller group of countries introducing such a tax if it
negatively impacted on those not participating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not
convinced of the case," Michael Noonan,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), Ireland's finance minister,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), told the meeting. "The proposals being made are
not acceptable to us in particular if applied to fewer than
27."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Annika Breidthardt and Robin

Lingering customers just one hurdle as Starbucks eyes China" )]

##  Lingering customers just one hurdle as Starbucks eyes China

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/BEIJING (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) is on the
rise in China with ambitious expansion plans but like any big new emerging
market there are teething problems, not least of which is that customers love
it so much, they stay for hours and hours and sometimes don't even buy a
drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Howard Schultz expects mainland
China to overtake Canada as Starbucks' second-largest market by 2014 and some
analysts believe it could one day rival the United States as the company's
biggest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For a decade the core business was expats
and tourists. Without question, the core business today is Chinese nationals,"
Schultz told Reuters ahead of a trip to Beijing and Shanghai to meet store
managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest coffee chain is a symbol of
Western affluence in a nation of tea drinkers. But the tendency for Chinese
visitors to linger in cafes and their lower income levels means sales volumes
are much smaller than the United States and other markets where taking drinks
to go is the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu Baoli, a 51-year-old stock trader in
Beijing, said he visits Starbucks at least 10 times a month but doesn't go for
the coffee. He is taking a break, surfing the Internet and meeting with
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers note that Chinese customers will bring
sometimes their own food to Starbucks and Xu admits that every so often he
doesn't bother to buy anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like the concept,"
said Xu. "Chinese people used to think you needed a spoon and saucer to drink
coffee. Now, walking around with a Starbucks cup in your hand has become a
fashion statement for Chinese."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the U.S. market
maturing, few prizes are as enticing as China and its population of more than
1.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks entered China in 1999 and now has
more than 570 stores in 48 cities. By 2015,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), it plans over 1,500 stores in
70-plus cities, though that would still only account for about half of China's
major cities and would be just a fraction of the 10,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ),800 cafes in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could very well be exactly what's
happening with Yum," Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of Destination Wealth
Management, referring to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). The U.S. fast-food
company got an early foothold in China and now gets more revenue from that
market than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Starbucks' China cafes
contribute less than 5 percent of company revenue, their store operating
profit margins, at around 22 percent, are higher than U.S. cafes because they
charge essentially U.S. prices in a market famed for its low labor and other
costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HURDLES TO GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with
that big silver lining, there are big impediments to growth including low
incomes, rising costs and the fact that most Chinese don't have a coffee
habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is still small, with specialist coffee
shops such as Starbucks booking sales of $358 million from mainland China in
2010, although that was up from $104 million in 2005,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), according to Euromonitor
International. By comparison, the United States accounts for $8 billion in
revenue for Starbucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers in China drink an average
of just three cups of coffee per year, according to an industry study,[Sac
Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), while for many Starbucks prices are
simply out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on average wages in China,[coach
outlet](http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/
"http://www.coachoutletusaonline.biz/" ), it would take 1.3 hours of work in
the more affluent east of China to buy a Starbucks tall (12-ounce) caramel
macchiato. That goes up to 1.6 hours in the west and 1.9 hours in central
China, says Bernstein Research analyst Sara
Senatore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordability remains a top concern for analysts,
who worry that as Starbucks' expansion progresses beyond the country's biggest
cities it will be less able raise prices to protect
margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But CEO Schultz said income has not been a barrier
to growth, adding that Starbucks' shops in non-core markets perform "as well
or better" than stores in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, helped by pent-up
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attracting quality employees when competition for
skilled workers is intensifying as other chains also seek to expand, is also
very difficult, says Paul French,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), chief China analyst for market research firm
Mintel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, Starbucks has announced plans to launch
a training program called Starbucks China University next year. It also will
unveil a 1 million yuan ($159,000) fund that will provide emergency financial
assistance for Starbucks employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwina

European bank bonus cuts mask basic pay hikes" )]

##  European bank bonus cuts mask basic pay hikes

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - European banks could face more pressure from
regulators and politicians worried that big cuts in bonuses have barely dented
a high-pay culture sustained by massive hikes in base salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A string of banks have grabbed headlines with big reductions in
handouts to staff for 2011. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), 82 percent state-
owned after a government bailout, is to cut its bonus payouts for 2011 by 58
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French bank Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) will lower
trader bonuses by 20 percent and larger rivals BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and
Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) have pledged cuts of 50
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said although RBS made a loss in 2011, this
reflected the business environment and costs from its legacy
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKFI said RBS management had made progress in
improving performance and had "exercised reasonable judgment" in its approach
to bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But critics say slicing away chunks of bonus
pots by banks masks concerns that base salaries and total pay remain too
high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investment banks still hand over nearly half
their revenues to staff. Many firms have raised basic pay while cutting annual
bonus payments since the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At RBS's investment bank
arm, the compensation to revenue ratio for 2011 rose to 41 percent from 34
percent in 2010, based on staff costs as a percentage of total
income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's average total pay, made up of total
salary plus bonus, for its investment bank in 2011 was down 26 percent,[sacs
louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), a much smaller drop than the cut
in bonuses alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers have become a focus for public
anger over the financial crisis, which tipped economies into recession and
left governments with huge debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators and politicians
have pushed banks to cut back on bonuses as a
result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ),
who used to get multimillion pound payouts in some cases,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), now get less and some payments are in shares and deferred to cut down on
excessive risk-taking blamed for the financial blow-up in
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would hate to be starting out in banking now," said
a senior banker based in Europe. "Pay isn't what it was and with so much
deferred you don't see a lot of it for years but it is still just as hard
work,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), and you
are vilified by everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers' bonus expectations were
already low because of the political and regulatory
pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But business have also suffered from the euro
zone crisis,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), leading to thousands of job cuts
across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are not expecting a good year.
The real revenue generators will still expect and get good pay, but for many
employees this year, the bonus will be keeping their job," said a London-based
investment banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also said: "The total comp
(compensation) might not have changed for a lot of
people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS Chairman Philip Hampton defended his bankers'
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If our people do two jobs -- build the core business
and eliminate the legacy of risk that we inherited -- then we should reward
successful progress," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said pay was "a thorny
issue" and it was right that RBS's pay should be at the "lower end of the
scale" but it could not be too far out of scale with
rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On banks' trading floors there is
frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole subject has got out of hand. The
bonus culture as they call it had gone awry but that doesn't mean it should be
done away with all together," said one London-based foreign exchange trader,
who declined to say how much his bonus had been cut by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
trader said banks were being vilified for decisions made in the years leading
up to the crisis and most trading floors now had much stricter risk
parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everything had got out of hand. It was over the
top but most of the villains of the piece have gone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He
said some common sense was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are in a
frontline trading position where you are primarily judged and rewarded on how
much you make, as long as they put sensible risk parameters in place, there's
nothing wrong with being paid a bonus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kylie

(ESV.N), with a largely brand-new ultra-deepwater fleet, rose sharply after
its third-quarter results came in ahead of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An
Ensco executive also reported no significant problems in getting its fleet to
meet new equipment standards, which have been tightened in response to the
Gulf of Mexico disaster in April 2010 that destroyed Transocean's Deepwater
Horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean Chief Executive Steven Newman said his
company's "historical leadership" in deepwater drilling meant its older rigs
bore a disproportionate amount of the cost of stronger
regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two-thirds of our fleet comes from prior
newbuild cycles. As far as the peer group is concerned, only one-third of
their fleet comes from prior newbuild cycles," Newman told analysts on a call
to discuss quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody else is a bit later
to the game than we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newman also said it was taking
longer to get equipment certified by original manufacturers such as Cameron
International Corp (CAM.N),[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N) and GE Oil &amp;
Gas (GE.N), because their facilities were overwhelmed with getting so much
work all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Transocean started with maintenance
and equipment certification work on its lucrative ultra-deepwater fleet, next
year it would focus on rigs that work in shallower
waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Ricardo Rosa said this would
mean less of a revenue hit,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), even if the work cost the same or
more, and he offered "highly preliminary" operating and maintenance expenses
guidance for 2012 of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
would be an increase from 2011, when he expected comparable expenses of $5.8
billion to $6 billion, which is up $200 million from previous guidance, and
represents the second increase in 2011 cost guidance in three
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Newman and Rosa fielded questions on the
outlook for Transocean's dividend given the rising costs and its recent $1.4
billion takeover of Norway's Aker Drilling, and their less-than-assured
answers led to a further drop in the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newman said
board discussions would begin on the dividend in the next few weeks, with a
final decision in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have indicated that we are
committed to a sustained dividend," Rosa said. "But clearly we have to take
all of the externalities into account."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts differed in
their interpretations of Transocean's adjusted third-quarter earnings per
share,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), excluding one-time items, but some
put the figure in the range of 23 to 27 cents. Analysts on average had
expected 77 cents, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensco earned 87 cents per share in the
quarter,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"
), compared with the average estimate of 82 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of
Transocean, which had already lost a fifth of their value in 2011, were down
12.8 percent at $48.84 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of Ensco, which had been down 9 percent this year, were up 6.7 percent
at $52.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) managed to
beat profit estimates last month,[moncler

##  Maybe no housing rebound for a generation Shiller

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Housing market is likely to remain weak and
may take a generation or more to rebound,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), Yale economics professor Robert Shiller told Reuters Insider on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shiller,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/

Factbox  How do you change a treaty" )]

##  Factbox How do you change a treaty

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - The European Union was divided over how to defuse a
sovereign debt crisis going into a do-or-die summit that starts with an
informal dinner in Brussels on Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paris and
Berlin need to win backing for their plan to amend the EU's Lisbon treaty to
toughen budget discipline, if they are to have it ready as they hope by
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all 27 EU states do not support more fiscal union
by adapting the Lisbon treaty, which took eight years to negotiate,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), then Sarkozy and Merkel want the
17 euro zone countries to go ahead alone with more
integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are details of what some EU nations would
have to do to enable changes to the Lisbon Treaty:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*
AUSTRIA: - Any EU treaty changes that require amendments to Austria's
constitution would have to be adopted with a two-thirds majority in
parliament. Officials have said any move toward creating a fiscal union in the
EU would trigger a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- Parliament ratified the
Lisbon Treaty in April 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* BELGIUM: - A treaty change of
the magnitude of the Lisbon Treaty needs to be approved by 9 parliamentary
bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- A spokesman for the Belgian federal parliament
said that in the past this complexity had not been an issue as both the Lisbon
treaty and the European constitutional treaty, which was later blocked by
referendums in France and the Netherlands, were ratified in time. A referendum
is not possible in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* BULGARIA/ROMANIA: - In both
Romania and Bulgaria only a simple parliamentary majority is needed to back
any EU treaty change. Both countries passed the Lisbon Treaty quickly and with
little debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CYPRUS: - A parliamentary vote is required
and is normally a formality. The Lisbon Treaty was swiftly
approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* CZECH REPUBLIC: - The Czech Republic would need
parliamentary approval for a treaty change. It would also have to be signed
off by eurosceptic President Vaclav Klaus. Klaus legally cannot refuse to sign
a treaty approved by parliament, but the constitution does not prescribe any
deadlines, so he could stretch out the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- Klaus had
refused to sign the Lisbon Treaty and was the last EU leader to sign in
November 2009. Klaus's second and final term runs out in February
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* DENMARK: - Under Denmark's constitution,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), international treaties can be
entered into only with the consent of parliament. Denmark ratified the Lisbon
Treaty by passing a regular bill in parliament in April 2008,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), without a referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- If there were to be a transfer
of authority to EU federal institutions, then a referendum would be needed in
Denmark after the legislation is adopted in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*
ESTONIA: - Estonia needs a parliamentary vote for amendments to the treaty.
The Lisbon treaty took four months to be passed by Estonia's
parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* FINLAND: - The Finnish parliament plays a
strong role in decision-making on EU affairs compared with many other member
states, and a treaty change would require approval by a majority. However,
parliament's position on EU issues are generally decided by the Grand
Committee. Finland's parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008, with
150 of 200 parliamentary votes in favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* FRANCE: - In
France, the president can decide whether to submit a vote on changes to the
Lisbon Treaty to parliament - known as a "congress" - or to a referendum.
After the French rejected the EU constitution in 2005, the president moved the
vote to the parliament, which approved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- After coming
to power in 2007,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to opt for a
parliamentary ratification to avoid the risk of a second rejected
referendum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GERMANY: - To ratify any treaty changes, both
Germany's lower and upper houses of parliament must give their approval and
the president must then rubber stamp the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\-
Germany was among the last four EU states to ratify the Lisbon Treaty in
September 2009, when legislation was delayed for more than a year following an
appeal to the country's Constitutional Court by a group of
lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GREECE: - Greece ratifies international
treaties, including ones on EU matters,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), in parliament. Theoretically, they can also be
ratified by referendum but this has never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\-
Greece ratified the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* HUNGARY: -
To approve any possible EU treaty change, the government submits a bill to
parliament, which will have to be endorsed by two-thirds of all lawmakers to
become law. Hungary became the first of the 27 EU countries to ratify the
treaty in a parliamentary vote on December 17, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*
IRELAND: - The Irish are entitled to vote on fundamental changes to EU
treaties and the government has admitted it would struggle to get new reforms
past an electorate still stung by Europe's hardline stance on the cost and
make-up of Ireland's EU-IMF bailout. The government has said it will seek
legal advice about whether a referendum will be needed when it has more
details of the proposed changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- Irish voters held up the
implementation of the Lisbon Treaty when they rejected it in 2009. It was
passed in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* ITALY: - Approval of any change to a
treaty would be through a vote in both houses of parliament. Italy approved
the Lisbon Treaty in July 2008 through a unanimous vote in the lower house of
parliament. The Senate had approved the treaty a week earlier. Formal
ratification occurred on August 8. It was the first time that a European
treaty had been approved unanimously in both houses of
parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* LATVIA: - Changes to treaties require a
parliamentary approval. However, the constitution says that more than half of
the 100-member parliament can demand a referendum on any "significant" changes
to treaties that guide Latvia's participation in the European
Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* LITHUANIA: - Treaty changes are approved by
parliament. Parliament ratified the Lisbon Treaty in May 2008 after just two
months. However an official said that depending on what is proposed, Lithuania
may need to alter the country's constitutional law which needs a bigger
majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NETHERLANDS: - A treaty change will have to be
put to a parliamentary vote, but would not require a referendum. The Lisbon
Treaty was put to a vote in parliament in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* POLAND: -
Poland does not require a referendum to change the EU Treaty as long as the
change does not force an amendment to the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\-
The change is very likely to be endorsed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's
centrist, pro-European cabinet. It then requires the parliament's approval
before President Bronislaw Komorowski - a close Tusk ally - signs it into
law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- The same procedure took place when the Lisbon Treaty
was approved in Poland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* PORTUGAL: - There is no formal
requirement in Portugal for a treaty change to be put through a referendum.
However the government can decide at any point to hold a referendum, seeking
greater legitimacy for controversial or sensitive
measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- The Lisbon Treaty only required parliamentary
approval and passed easily in April 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SLOVAKIA: -
Parliament needs to approve any changes in international treaties with a
constitutional majority,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), which means at least 90 votes out of
total 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- Slovakia approved the Lisbon Treaty in April
2008 after weeks of political bickering among opposition and coalition parties
over domestic non-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* SPAIN: - The Lisbon
treaty was ratified by Spain's lower house of parliament in June 2008 and then
by the upper house in an extraordinary session in July 2008. Royal approval
was given days later on July 30, 2008. A parliamentary vote would be needed
for any changes as a result of the December 9 summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*
SWEDEN: - Parliament would need to approve any changes to the EU treaty. The
sitting coalition government does not have a majority and would need
opposition support to pass such a change. Sweden approved the Lisbon Treaty in
a parliamentary vote in November 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* UNITED KINGDOM: -
The European Union Act, which came into force in July 2011, states that any
proposed future EU treaty or amendment to existing treaties and ratchet
clauses that transfer competences or power from the UK to the EU would require
a referendum, although the government has said proposals currently under
discussion in Brussels do not fall into that bracket. An act of UK parliament
is required before any EU law can take effect in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\-
Limited treaty changes which do not transfer powers from London to Brussels
must still be approved by an act of parliament before the UK can agree to them
- this used to be just a vote in both houses of
parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\- Britain says a treaty just between 17
countries would not need to be considered by parliament, but one between all
27 in the bloc would. The UK officially ratified the Lisbon Treaty in July
2008 after parliament voted it into law the month
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Reuters Bureaux (Reporting by David Cutler,

Weak euro zone casts long shadows" )]

##  Weak euro zone casts long shadows

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Drug dealers, money launderers and assorted cash-
only criminals love the convenience of the 500 euro note. Will bankers also
soon be clamoring for wads of the high-value bill?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
question arises because the European Central Bank might have to lower interest
rates further to revive growth. Business surveys this week are likely to show
the euro zone economy remaining flat on its back in August after contracting
by 0.2 percent in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ECB has
already cut to zero the interest it pays banks on excess reserves. So driving
the deposit rate into negative territory -- charging banks for the privilege
of parking surplus funds -- would force lenders to weigh up the alternative of
withdrawing cash and stashing it somewhere safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea
sounds outlandish. Not so. ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure addressed
it back in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the costs associated with
holding large amounts of banknotes, it is likely that significantly negative
interest rates would be required to trigger a switch from money holding to
investment in banknotes," Coeure said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the
economic recovery the ECB was anticipating has failed to materialize,
prompting the move to a zero deposit rate and leading economists to take a
closer look at the cost of warehousing notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The physical
storage would be easy; if withdrawn as 500 euro notes,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), 1 billion euros (plus two big security guards) would easily fit into a VW
Golf and the cash into existing bank safes. Harder to gauge are the
inconvenience and insurance-type costs, which will affect banks' response,"
Greg Fuzesi of JP Morgan wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasse Holboell
Nielsen, an economist with Goldman Sachs, has examined the case of non-euro
member Denmark, whose central bank set a deposit rate of minus 0.2 percent
over a month ago, to tease out the implications for the euro
zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a bank with 40 billion Danish crowns ($6.60
billion) on deposit,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), he reckons it would make economic sense to take out
cash once the interest rate drops below -0.52 percent or -0.65 percent,
depending on the fixed-cost assumptions for insurance, transport and vault
rental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because Denmark's central bank has not encountered
any unexpected fallout since it went negative, Nielsen concludes that it could
cut the deposit rate by another quarter-point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And based on
Denmark's experience, he judges a negative deposit rate at the ECB of 0.25
percent is quite feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL EYES ON THE CENTRAL
BANKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steen Jakobsen,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), chief economist with Saxo Bank in
Copenhagen, said he expected a weak euro zone purchasing mangers' survey on
Thursday would ratchet up the pressure on ECB President Mario Draghi to
act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If anything, it will support the argument that Draghi
feels the need to do something about the monetary transmission mechanism
because the numbers will just continue to weaken," Jakobsen
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, he said a marked slowdown in China,
which also releases a poll of purchasing executives on Thursday, boded ill for
exports from Germany, Europe's biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey

##  Treasury to announce $25 billion profit on mortgage bonds W

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - The Treasury Department may announce on Monday that
taxpayers have made a $25 billion profit on mortgage bonds purchased at the
height of the meltdown, the Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury had spent about $225 billion on purchases of mortgage debt
over 16 months before it began selling the securities last year,[borse

said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government last week sold the last of the bonds,

Nightmare of disorderly default focuses minds on Greece" )]

##  Nightmare of disorderly default focuses minds on Greece

&lt;p&gt;ATHENS (Reuters) - Argentina's chaotic bankruptcy a decade ago
triggered riots, looting and dozens of deaths. The prospect of that horror
scenario playing out in Greece is focusing minds across Europe as the threat
of default remains all too real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At best, if private
creditors walk away from a voluntary debt restructuring, a disorderly default
would shut Greek banks for days to give Athens time to prevent a bank run by
reassuring depositors that the lenders will not go bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
worst, if EU partners also pull the plug,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ),
Greece risks a chaotic descent into an extended bank freeze, possible
shortages of basic goods, violence and what central bank governor George
Provopoulos called the "hell" of a euro exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If banks were
hit, I could not import goods any more. I would have nothing to sell. How
would I survive?" 66-year old shop manager Antonis Broukias asked in his old-
fashioned books and stationery store in central Athens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I
will surely shut down my shop, especially if we return to the drachma,"
Broukias said, adding that he was worried protests could turn
violent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athens and its private creditors are scrambling to
avoid a messy default that could drag the whole euro zone into a much deeper
crisis. But talks have stalled and the clock is ticking down to a major bond
redemption due in late March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a deal is struck,
Greece's EU and IMF lenders have made clear they will not sanction a 130
billion euros bailout package unless Athens pushes through more budget cuts
and implements a series of long-agreed austerity reforms. If unimpressed, they
could pull the plug on aid at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of Greek
people and businesses if there is no deal with private creditors, who are
being asked to take hefty losses as part of the new bailout, largely depends
on whether the EU,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), European Central Bank and IMF - tired with Athens'
failure to meet reform targets - would stand by Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
they don't, people worried that the banks might shut or their deposits could
be turned into a new currency would likely rush to get their money out,
prompting a run on the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be the first and
most visible effect of a crisis that would hit the whole country of about 11
million people, which has just entered its fifth consecutive year of deep
recession and depends on external support to stay
afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Leaving the euro would be a disaster," said 73-year
old pensioner Petros Haris. "If you ever win the lottery, take it all out of
the country!" he said as one of Athens' many street lottery vendors walked
by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His 30-year-old son, a lawyer who came back from France
four years ago to set up his own business, is considering leaving again, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURO EXIT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the worst-case
scenario, Athens would struggle to pay pensions and salaries for its bloated
public sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greek banks - which hold around 45 billion
euros of junk Greek government bonds - would need to be recapitalized, which
would mean nationalization. After a default, they would likely be shut out of
ECB borrowing if the bloc's central bank stuck to its
rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial system would freeze and could force the
Mediterranean country, which witnessed a strong economic boom when it joined
the euro currency, to seek an exit from the euro zone just a decade later,
analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If international lenders pull the plug, there
will be a need for a new currency because after a certain point the state
would not be able to function without printing money,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
)," said one Greek banking analyst who did not want to be
named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would face circumstances similar to Argentina,
there would be lines outside banks the size of Florida ... It would be tough
to stay in the euro after a disorderly default."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue
that a euro exit would help Greece regain its competitiveness leaving it
better off in the long run. But central banker George Provopoulos has warned
that a return to the drachma would be a nightmare, with a devaluation of the
new currency reaching 60-70 percent.
[ID:nL6E7NU25R]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), hospitals and other public
services would face operational difficulties during a transition period,
Provopoulos said, warning of possible shortages of imported goods including
fuel, raw materials and even agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If
Greece leaves the euro zone, we'll be looking at a sharp devaluation of the
new currency and inflation is going to go through the roof," said Diego
Iscaro, senior economist at IHS Global Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If external
funding collapses, they may not be able to pay for imports, people may not be
able to find basic products in supermarkets," he said,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), while it would take a long time for
competitiveness to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vast majority of Greeks want
the country to stay in the euro, although they are angry with wage cuts and
tax hikes demanded by the EU and the IMF in return for
aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our life would be a lot worse if we left the euro. It
would be like going back to the 70's, these were tough times," said Yannis
Korelis, 60, a public sector worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, large
parts of Greece were very poor and tens of thousands left to seek a better
life abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would be practical problems too.
Argentina kept the same currency although it was sharply devalued. If Greece
switched back to the drachma, it would have to print it - the design, printing
and circulation of the euro took 2-1/2 years, Provopoulos
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the height of the Latin American nation's crisis,
provinces started issuing their own script currency to pay pubic employees. In
northern Greece, where unemployment is sky-high, some communities have started
using alternative currencies such as coupons to barter basic goods or
services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANARCHY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, the bank
deposit freeze was the tipping point, triggering mass violent protests. People
took to the streets banging pots and pans to protest against an economic
collapse that plunged millions into poverty. The government declared a stage
of siege and presidents resigned one after another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was
really anarchy," said Iscaro, who now covers countries such as Greece for IHS
Global Insight in London but is originally from Argentina and worked in a bank
there at the height of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the worst of the
riots they tried to set the building on fire," Iscaro said. "People in a
desperate position would come to the bank and say: 'if you don't give me my
money I will kill myself'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Greece, where people angry
with austerity and record high unemployment have protested almost daily and
pelted politicians with yoghurt and eggs, violence is a risk but it is very
hard to predict how bad it will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country has a long
tradition of street protests that can turn violent - three died when a bank
was torched down during an anti-austerity protest in 2010 - but rallies have
failed to attract a strong turnout in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What
we have now is a typical case of manic depression," said Yanis Varoufakis,
professor of economics at the University of Athens. "In this situation you go
from being catatonic - this is the stage we are in now -- to being extremely
agitated and violent. Predicting the switch from one state to the other is
impossible for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the very prospect anarchy which
means the rest of Europe is unlikely to turn its back
completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid this worst case scenario and the
serious risks of contagion to the rest of the euro zone it entails, the EU is
more likely to continue helping Greece and the ECB to support its banks,
analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the back of the mind of northern European
decision- makers there is always the fear of instability," said Guillermo
Nielsen,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), who as Argentine finance secretary led
talks with creditors after the default?.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Greece plays very
well the geopolitical card ... The rest of Europe will have to foot the bill,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would strongly limit the risk of a severe bank
run, because Greek banks would still benefit from the guarantee of the
European Central Bank's safety net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Watch the banks," said
Nielsen. "If the Greek people move forward without panicking and going for
their money, you can handle it ... A disorderly default, it's the bank
run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Renee Maltezou, George

Chinese Estates head to be prosecuted in Macau over bribery" )]

##  Chinese Estates head to be prosecuted in Macau over bribery

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong tycoon Joseph Lau, who heads
developer Chinese Estates Holdings (0127.HK), will face prosecution over
bribery and money laundering in a land deal in Asia's gambling capital, Macau,
Chinese Estates said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A court in
Macau on Wednesday formally accepted an accusation by the public prosecutor
that Lau had a case to answer on the charges, the company said. The court
denied a request by Lau that the case be thrown out for lack of evidence. No
date was set for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the second high-profile
corruption case involving a Hong Kong property company in two months,
following the arrests on suspicion of bribery in late March of Thomas and
Raymond Kwok,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), who run Asia's largest developer,
Sun Hung Kai Properties (0016.HK). Their estranged brother, Walter, the former
head of the company, was arrested at the start of this month
[ID:nL4E8G40DV]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lau, 61, is Hong Kong's fifth-richest man,
according to Forbes, worth $6.5 billion as of February. The former Goldman
Sachs employee was one of the first people to buy a Boeing 787 Dreamliner for
personal use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also collects art and red wine, and has
invested heavily in London property. The divorced tycoon's love life is a
staple of Hong Kong's tabloids, with Lau linked to a string of former Miss
Hong Kongs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor in Macau has alleged in court
that Lau, chairman and CEO of Chinese Estates, and another high-profile
tycoon, Steven Lo, chairman of the South China Football Club and movie-and-
music entertainment group BMA Investment, offered a HK$20 million ($2.6
million) bribe to a former Macau government official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They
prosecutor alleged they did so to assure the purchase of five plots of land
next to the Macau International Airport and near the Cotai Strip,[scarpe

/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), a string of casinos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese
Estates is building a multi-tower luxury development on the site, naming it La
Scala, after the Milan opera house. Lo sold Chinese Estates the

of land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL.N),
which put in the winning bid for Full Moon, told Reuters it was assisting with
the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former official alleged to have been
bribed, Ao Man-long, was Macau's secretary for transport and public works and
the most senior government figure ever arrested by Macau's anti-graft agency.
He is already serving 28-1/2 years in jail for accepting bribes to speed
approval of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claims that Lau paid a bribe
surfaced in a new trial, with Ao facing six fresh charges of bribery and three
of money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lau has denied any
wrongdoing.[ID:nL6E8FHBJ1] He was called as a witness in Ao's new trial but
did not appear,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/

##  Freddie Mac to name Layton CEO WSJ report

&lt;p&gt;n"&gt;(Reuters) - Freddie Mac is preparing to name Donald Layton, the
former chief executive of online brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp, as its next
CEO,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), the Wall Street Journal said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citing people familiar with the matter, the report
said the company is expected to announce the hiring as soon as
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal said the appointment would end a six-
month search for the mortgage giant's third chief executive in the four years
since the government took control of it. Layton will replace Charles Haldeman,
who said in October he would step down this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freddie
Mac declined comment on the Journal report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Journal said
Layton had been considered the front runner for the job for more than a month.
His appointment is subject to approval by the Treasury Department and Federal
Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Freddie and Fannie
Mae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said two years ago, the Treasury Department
named Layton an outside director of American International Group Inc (AIG.N),
the insurer that received a government bailout in 2008. On that board, he
serves alongside Christopher Lynch,[pochette louis

), who became chairman of Freddie Mac in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last
week, Freddie Mac, the No. 2 provider of U.S. mortgage money, said it will
seek another $19 million in taxpayer aid after its quarterly profit failed to
make up for a dividend payment to the government for its controlling
stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has drawn $72.3 billion from the U.S.
Treasury since being seized by the government in 2008,[Moncler Sito

months of the year,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-

Mac reported net income of $577 million, down from $676 million in the year-
ago quarter. The drop was mainly due to derivatives losses totaling $1.06
billion, up from $427 million a year earlier and $766 million in the previous
three-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company,[moncler

##  Bond King Bill Gross America Wont Default, but Fiscal Crisi

&lt;p&gt;Standard &amp; Poor’s may have cut its outlook for the U.S.,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), but Bill Gross, head of the country’s largest
bond fund, tells R.M. Schneiderman we won’t default on our debt—though it may
take a fiscal crisis for Washington to solve our deficit
problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the talk of and to solve America’s long-
term budget deficits, the head of the country’s largest bond fund says the
gridlock in Washington will not ease over the next two years—and that a fiscal
crisis may ensue before any real progress occurs. But a U.S. debt default, he
says,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), will not be the end
result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview Wednesday, Bill Gross,[Sac Louis

), co-founder of the California-based Pacific Investment Management
Company,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ), or Pimco, said continued inaction on the
budget deficit could lead to an erosion of wealth. “The negative repercussions
would be a lower dollar, higher inflation, and artificially low interest
rates,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ),” he said. “All surreptitiously
pick the pockets of investors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Standard
&amp; Poor’s, one of the three main credit rating agencies, lowered its
triggering a wave of jitters among investors. In an effort to reassure them,
and other White House officials said the nation’s credit rating would never
fall below triple-A, the highest grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Gross said
S&amp;P is only stating the obvious. The fiscal situation of the United States
is “God-awful,” he said. “Washington talks a big game [but] then goes off
doing what it always does—spending money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gross, who has
been in touch frequently with the White House and various government officials
since the 2008 financial crisis, said he has a deep respect for the lawmakers
who are trying to combat the nation’s debt problems. Yet at least in part
because of the balance of power in Washington and the highly partisan climate,
Gross is skeptical that anything constructive will happen before the situation
becomes dire. Only a crisis,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), he said, is likely to break the
impasse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. can’t and won’t default on its debt,” he
said. “But if you buy U.S. Treasuries today you will be receiving a pittance
relative to what you can get [buying] bonds in Canada or bonds in
Germany.”&lt;/p&gt;Related Theme Articles:

##  Slowdown What’s Wrong With the Real Economy - The Daily B

&lt;p&gt;The likely reason? Uncertainty. Large manufacturers are getting fewer
incoming orders as businesses brace for bad news at year’s end,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" ), whether in the form
of fiscal cliff or more European woes. New orders fell 0.9 percent from
July,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
while imports fell by 1.5 percent. But there’s good news. The ISM’s employment
index registered at 51.6 percent,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), indicating hiring is still expanding in manufacturing. Manufacturers aren’t
exactly stretched thin—they’re waiting for customers to show up. Just take a
look at the ISM customers’ inventories index,[Moncler Sito

Economy  Harvard Gets Caught In The Credit Crunch - Newsweek" )]

##  Economy Harvard Gets Caught In The Credit Crunch - Newsweek

&lt;p&gt;The recent market turmoil portends hard times for even the wealthiest
universities. Last week, Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust stakeholders
that,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ), with
the research service Moody's projecting "a 30 percent decline in the value of
college and university endowments in the current fiscal year," Harvard needs
"to be prepared to absorb unprecedented endowment losses and plan for a period
of greater financial constraint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any investor could have
avoided the credit catastrophe, it should have been Harvard. Harvard, the
ultimate long-term investor (it's been compounding assets for more than 350
years),[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), sports the nation's leading
business school and counts a host of financial geniuses among its many
distinguished alumni. But judging by one snapshot of a portion of Harvard's
gigantic endowment, Harvard's recent financial performance is less than
impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The has the enviable but challenging task of
managing Harvard's mammoth endowment. As of June 30, 2008, HMC managed more
than $45 billion, the vast majority of it endowment assets. (Here's HMC's and
data on its .) HMC parcels out big chunks of the endowment to outside
managers—hedge funds, private-equity firms, asset managers of all stripes—and
its staff manages a large chunk itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the granular
data on who manages what and how much Harvard has invested in which assets
aren't publicly available. But every quarter, HMC files a 13-F form with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating a portion of its holdings in
publicly traded securities—stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds. The 13-F is a
snapshot and is not fully representative of Harvard's overall holdings. But
the chunk of the portfolio revealed in the most recent looks like it was
chosen by someone who watched a few episodes of CNBC's Squawk Box and heard
that the hot new investments were emerging markets, commodities, and private
equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 13-F shows Harvard with some 231 positions worth
nearly $2.9 billion,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), highly
concentrated in popped macroeconomic bubble plays. The top 10
holdings,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), which Bloomberg helpfully breaks
out, account for 70 percent of the value of the disclosed holdings. Virtually
all of them performed rather poorly in the third quarter,[Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), and virtually all of them have slid in the weeks since Sept.
30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest position disclosed—all amounts and dollar
values are as of Sept. 30—was $463 million in the iShares MSCI Emerging Market
fund. As the , that fund's off nearly 60 percent from this summer and down by
about one-third from the end of September. Third-largest was a $233 million
position in Weyerhauser, the wood-products giant that has fallen about 40
percent since the end of September. The top 10 included $232 million in the
iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), off about 40 percent since the end
of September; about $51 million in the iPATH MSCI India Index, off about one-
third since the end of September; and $158 million in the iShares FTSE/Xinhua
China Index, off about 30 percent since the end of September. For good
measure, top 10 holdings also included index funds that were plays on South
Africa's commodity-based economy and on the perennially emerging market of
Mexico. Would it surprise you to learn that both of those investments, after
fairing poorly in the third quarter, have fallen further in the fourth
quarter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this emerging-market-heavy filing is clearly
not representative of Harvard's overall asset-management strategy. As HMC's ,
the endowment allocated about 11 percent of its total to emerging market
stocks. (By contrast, nearly half of the portfolio described in HMC's 13-F was
in emerging market stocks.) But it does show that even the best, most
experienced, and highly regarded long-term investors can get suckered into
new-era thinking and make investments that turn out to be highly risky bets.
The 13-F shows that the managers running this Harvard porfolio were huge
believers in the decoupling theory—i.e., that emerging markets would continue
to thrive even as the United States stalled—and in the notion that commodities
would keep booming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did this belief persist for so long?
The answer would make a great Harvard Business School case
study.&lt;/p&gt;Related Theme Articles:

##  Russia's Yandex has international ambitions

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Internet search company Yandex, fresh from
raising $1.3 billion from an IPO, now has the clout to make an impact farther
from its Russian heartland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IPO is the biggest U.S.
Internet listing since Google Inc went public in 2004, and is a long-held plan
for the two founders,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" ),[&lt;a

"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )&lt;/a&gt;, who met as teenagers at
school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh said the
company's success was emblematic of a new Russia -- distinct from the
country's energy-focused economy -- and said there is a place in the world for
a "global technology company born in Russia".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Russia is
famous for its resources,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )," said Volozh. "But Russia also has
a lot of talent... Russia deserves to have a technology company of a global
level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPO values Yandex at around $8 billion but the
duo, who founded Yandex in 1997, will retain most of their
holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their rise is distinct from many of Russia's other
billionaires,[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html
"http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" ), a number of which built
their empires during the 1990s and profited from a boom in
commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich, 46,
described how the pair met at school, excelled at math and physics and got
such good marks that teachers suspected them of
copying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volozh, who has a degree in applied
mathematics,[&lt;a href="http://www.hoocl.com/" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" )&lt;/a&gt;, began working on search technology in
1989. A year later, he started his own search software development firm, where
he was joined by Segalovich, who had studied to be a
geophysicist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yandex was founded in
1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000 Yandex lost $2 million on revenue of $72,000.
Last year the company generated revenue of $445 million and earnings of $135
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I see this as one day on our way -- not the
end,[&lt;a href="http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" target="_blank" style
="text-decoration: none;"&gt;pochette louis

)&lt;/a&gt;," Segalovich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the company is looking at
several ideas to go beyond its current business model, such as further
expansion beyond Russia,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ), although he declined to give
details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have several ideas (about) how to go beyond our
current business models," Segalovich said. "Definitely there are some new
business models we are trying to explore and also international expansion is
one of the new areas for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segalovich said Yandex has not
yet decided how to use the proceeds of the IPO but that it could be
potentially useful for acquisitions,&lt;a
href="<http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/>" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )&lt;/a&gt;, noting that Yandex's rivals
have large cash piles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The landscape may change
very fast," said Segalovich. "We may require maybe (an) acquisition or changes
in strategy ... The Internet is very dynamic and growing very fast and all our
big rivals are very rich."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOPHISTICATED
ALGORITHMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yandex's search algorithm, originally developed
to conduct keyword searches of patents, Russian classical literature and the
Bible,&lt;a href="<http://www.cooses.com/>" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" )&lt;/a&gt;, was a breakthrough as it accounted for
the Russian language's complex grammar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The duo coined the
name "Yandex" -- with "Ya" standing for the Russian equivalent to English
pronoun "I" -- as Segalovich was experimenting with derivatives of words that
described the essence of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full name
originally stood for "Yet Another iNDEX." Today the word "Yandex" has become
synonymous with Internet search in Russian-speaking countries, as people
suggest "asking Yandex" for answers to their
inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segalovich said Yandex was not language specific
and could create world-class products. Yandex has a website with limited
coverage of English language pages,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ), he said, describing the quality of those pages as
good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launching the IPO on Nasdaq on Tuesday, Volozh called
out in Russian Yandex's tagline "Everything will be found" and offered some
advice for tech entrepreneurs in Russia looking to become the next
Yandex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stick to your ideas, grow them into real
businesses, serve your audience, focus on quality,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), have fun and get rich," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yandex shares closed up
55 percent, or $13.84 to $38.84.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Megan

bankrupt hotel operator's properties for about $1 billion in a transaction
that could become official as soon as Thursday, according to the person, who
spoke anonymously because talks are private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parties are
confident the deal will get done, though it is not official and could still
unravel, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement would avoid a trial
scheduled for next week over a decision by Cerberus and Chatham to walk away
from a previous agreement to buy the same 64 hotel properties for $1.12

downgrades in the lodging sector, weakening hotel asset sales, and a 30
percent to 40 percent decline in the shares of competing hotel operators

stable and its hotels had performed "at or near budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It

##  Toll Brothers gets more for homes, posts profit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL.N)
reported a surprise quarterly profit as it offered fewer buyer incentives and
benefited from a tax break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toll's shares were up 2.5
percent after results showed it building on a competitive advantage it first
established years ago by making homebuilding in urban areas a part of its core
business, said Morningstar analyst Mike Gaiden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most
of Toll's peers among publicly traded homebuilders do some of that business,
only Toll has made it a focus. A substantial percentage of Toll's business is

areas better than many of their publicly traded peers, Toll is able to salvage
profitability," Gaiden said. "They have flat to growing sales while most of

a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear
whether that figure compared directly with the reported
number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toll's average home price rose 7 percent to $586,000
in the quarter, but the company said it expects a decline to a range of
$540,000 and $565,000 for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homes in
cities and closer-in suburbs that Toll is increasingly building carry lower
price tags than larger detached homes further out, although they might be more
expensive on a square-foot basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fifth year of the
housing slump, most homebuilders continue to suffer as they compete in a
market oversupplied with cut-rate foreclosures and short sales that are a
legacy of a housing boom fueled by subprime lending and
speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Toll's high-end products do not compete
directly with foreclosures as some rivals,[&lt;a

homebuyer, the company is still struggling to close sales with buyers
concerned that the new home will lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S&amp;P
/Case-Shiller Home Price Index fell by 3.9 percent in the fourth
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is still tough; the home buyer is still
wary," Yearley Jr. said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest results
include a tax benefit of $20.4 million. Without that, the company lost $17
million,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),

items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Toll were up 2.2 percent at $21.21 in late
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Helen

string of misselling cases has beset Britain's financial services industry for
more than two decades. Banks are already set to pay more than 9 billion pounds
($13.96 billion) in compensation to customers for misselling loan
insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority said in June

misled about such products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSA said the seven banks
make up only around 10 percent of the overall market for interest-rate hedging
product sales in Britain and said it had not examined their sales and so had
not found any finding of misselling to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the
number of their sales was smaller and while there is no presumption that
misselling has occurred,[Moncler Sito

found evidence of "serious failings" by banks and its findings could lead to
compensation claims ranging from many millions to several billion pounds from
small companies who bought them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products range in
complexity from caps that fix an upper limit to the interest rate on a loan,
through to complex derivatives known as "structured collars" which fixed

Private sector slowdown heightens recession fears" )]

##  Private sector slowdown heightens recession fears

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Private sector business activity in
Europe and China declined sharply this month, and new claims for U.S. jobless
benefits remained high, underlining fears that the global economy could lapse
back into recession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The euro zone's dominant service
sector saw a shock contraction in September, its first in two years. Its
manufacturing sector, which drove most of the bloc's recovery,[sacs Louis
Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), shrank for the second month
running, surveys showed on Thursday. For details, see&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the
United States, new claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but the
decrease was not enough to alleviate recession
worries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This just adds to the plethora of bad news in
recent weeks, and it is not good for the outlook,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
)," said Jacob Oubina,[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), senior U.S. economist at RBC
Capital Markets in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from China showed once-
booming manufacturing contracted for a third consecutive month, suggesting the
world's No. 2 economy may not be able to provide much of a counterweight to
slowdowns in Western economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data from around the
world emphasized Wednesday's message from the U.S. Federal Reserve. The
central bank warned of significant risks to the already weak economy and
launched a new plan to lower long-term borrowing costs,[&lt;a

)&lt;/a&gt;,[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" ),
just hours after the Bank of England signaled it was ready to pump in more
money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. jobless claims report "gives more backing to
the Fed's decision yesterday to provide more stimulation,[scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" )," said Rudy Narvas, senior economist at Societe
Generale in New York. "The economy is chugging along near stall
speed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other U.S. data,[Sac Louis

)&lt;/a&gt;, home prices edged up in July, according to the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, while a gauge of future economic activity rose in August but
still signaled weak growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe,[borse

href="<http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/>" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )&lt;/a&gt;, the Flash Markit Eurozone
Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures business activity at
thousands of firms from banks to restaurants, sank to 49.1 this month from
August's 51.5, far below a consensus forecast of 51.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None
of the 37 economists polled by Reuters had predicted that services activity
would contract and this is the first time since August 2009 the index has been
below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
was a similar picture in the manufacturing sector,&lt;a
href="<http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/>" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )&lt;/a&gt;, which had driven a large
part of the bloc's recovery. The factory index dropped to its lowest level in
two years to 48.4, slightly below expectations of a fall to
48.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers are still consistent with some GDP
growth, so it does not signal recession just yet," said Martin Enlund at
Handelsbanken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), we are seeing a slow-motion train
crash in the euro area, where credit contraction risks leading to a new
recession by Christmas unless governments face up to the task swiftly and
forcefully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new-business index for the service sector
fell to 48.3 from 51.4 in August, the first contraction in more than two
years. The backlogs of work index meanwhile showed that for a third
consecutive month some activity was driven by firms running down old
orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street tumbled about 3 percent in early morning
trading, and European stocks were also hit by the weak data and the Fed's
bleak outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Euro zone leaders have come under fire for
not acting fast enough in the fight to contain the debt
crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday
that Europe and the United States could slip back into recession next year
without bold action and forward-looking data suggested the situation was
unlikely to improve anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance ministers and
central bankers of the Group of 20 leading nations were gathering in
Washington for meetings of the G20 and the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven world
leaders demanded Europe take more decisive action against its debt crisis,
while a European Central Bank study warned the entire euro currency project
was now in peril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC's China Flash PMI dipped to 49.4 from
August's final figure of 49.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists and Chinese
officials have widely predicted China's growth will slow, largely because of
waning exports. The country, known as the factory to the world, is especially
vulnerable to fading demand from the United States and Europe, its two biggest
export markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of rising inflationary pressures
the central bank has tightened policy, but many economists say it will pause
its year-long campaign to see how the global turmoil plays
out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Julie Haviv and Emily Flitter

Toshiba faces $100 million gender bias lawsuit" )]

##  Toshiba faces $100 million gender bias lawsuit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior human resources manager at Toshiba Corp
has filed a $100 million lawsuit accusing a U.S. unit of the Japanese
technology company of gender bias against women in pay and
promotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, Elaine Cyphers, contends that
Toshiba America Inc pays women lower salaries and bonuses than men who perform
similar work. She alleges the company steers women into lower-grade positions
and favors men in promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this results in an
"astounding lack of women in leadership positions," despite Toshiba's creation
six years ago of a "Gender Equality Office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toshiba
spokesman Tom Gallatin in an email said the company generally does not discuss
pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Cyphers did not immediately
return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyphers said she has been
human resources manager at Toshiba America Nuclear Energy Corp and the
highest-ranking U,[borse moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/
"http://www.hoocl.com/" ).S,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/

unit. She said she was paid $90,000 to $91,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ),800 a year between 2008 and 2010,
while men in similar jobs at Toshiba were paid about $120,000
annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is the latest of many accusing
companies of favoring men over women in the workplace. It seeks class-action
status on behalf of all current and former Toshiba female employees in the
United States. Cyphers said she also filed a complaint with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last July, Novartis AG
agreed to pay $175 million to settle a class-action lawsuit accusing the Swiss
drugmaker of discriminating against 5,&lt;a href="<http://www.hoocl.com/>"
target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/" )&lt;/a&gt;,600 women
sales representatives in pay and promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer
representing Cyphers was involved in that case,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme
Court is expected to decide by June whether Wal-Mart Stores Inc must continue
to defend against the largest U.S. class-action gender bias lawsuit in
history, brought on behalf of as many as 1.5 million current and former female
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyphers said she had worked in human resources
for a quarter century before Toshiba hired her in June 2008,[Canada

miles to Falls Church,[&lt;a href="http://www.cooses.com/" target="_blank"

for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Toshiba soon promoted a less
experienced man to a new position above her,&lt;a

decoration: none;"&gt;[moncler bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/

her from the company in retaliation for complaints about
discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cyphers returned last month from
medical leave, a supervisor told her to leave and not to return "until further
notice," so she "promptly collected her belongings" and left, the complaint
said. She now lives in North Carolina, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is

##  Barclays dragged into new probe after Libor blow

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays Plc revealed a new regulatory probe and
more U.S,[Moncler Sito Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ). lawsuits on Friday, making it
harder for the British lender to rebuild its reputation damaged by the central
role it played in the interest rate-rigging scandal shaking banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these latest blows, Barclays' profit of more than 4 billion
pounds ($6.3 billion) in the first six months of the year beat forecasts. The
bank said its performance during July was ahead of last year and there had
been no exodus of clients, sending its shares up more than 7
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays said Britain's financial regulator had
started an investigation into the bank and four current and former senior
employees, including finance director Chris Lucas, on whether the bank made
sufficient disclosures about the fees it paid in a 2008 capital
raising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fees were payable under commercial agreements
related to deals in June and November 2008. It agreed to get advisory services
from Qatar Investment Authority and explore a relationship with Japan's
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays raised 4.5 billion
pounds in June 2008, including from SMBC,[sacs louis
vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), followed by a 7 billion cash call
in November that year from Qatar and Abu Dhabi investors to avoid taking a
government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has said it paid 300 million
pounds in fees on the latter deal, including about 116 million pounds to Qatar
Holding and 110 million to Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed al Nahhan, a member of Abu
Dhabi's royal family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Jenkins was the main architect
of that fundraising. He left Barclays in early 2009, setting up a Middle East
advisory boutique. He is now with Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual.
Jenkins declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation, which the
FSA has started in the past month, does not regard payments to Barclays
staff,[&lt;a href="http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" target="_blank"
style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" )&lt;/a&gt;, people familiar with the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays also faces more U.S. lawsuits after a
record 290 million pound ($455,[Canada Goose Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/
"http://www.cooses.com/" ).3 million) fine last month for rigging the Libor
interest rate benchmark, sparking fierce criticism about its culture and risk-
taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen other banks are expected to be
drawn into the global Libor investigation and could also be
fined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are sorry for the issues that have emerged over
recent weeks and recognize that we have disappointed our customers and
shareholders," Chairman Marcus Agius said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am
confident we can, and will,[pochette louis
vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
), repair the reputational damage done to our business in their eyes and those
of all our stakeholders," Agius said, reaffirming a commitment to deliver a
return on equity of 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays is searching for a
new chief executive and chairman after they quit following the Libor
scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agius said the board was focused on filling those
positions, but gave no update on likely timing. Investors are keen for one or
both of the CEO or chairman to come from outside, to be able to implement a
far-reaching overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new chairman should be chosen
first,[&lt;a href="http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"
target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;scarpe
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com
/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html" )&lt;/a&gt;, so the new chief executive knows who
will be in the chair, Agius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former J.P. Morgan banker
Bill Winters is favorite to be CEO and former UK Cabinet Secretary Gus
O'Donnell is front-runner for chairman, according to industry sources and UK
media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inquiry by UK lawmakers into the Libor
scandal showed that Britain's financial regulator had warned Barclays four
months earlier that its culture was too aggressive and must change. It exposed
a strained relationship with regulators, and as the backlash built, the Bank
of England effectively forced Bob Diamond to resign as chief
executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agius, a Cambridge- and Harvard-educated pillar
of London banking who has been criticized for not reining in Diamond, has
taken on executive duties but will leave when a successor is found,[borse
moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/ "http://www.hoocl.com/"
).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE LAWSUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays had already been
named as a defendant in class action lawsuits in U.S. federal courts for its
role as a contributor to the U.S. dollar Libor panel. Another class action was
filed for its roles on Japanese Yen Libor panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new
class action was started on July 6 against Barclays and other Euribor panel
banks alleging manipulation, and the bank and a current and former director
have been named as defendants in a pending class action for its role as a
Libor contributor and alleging mis-statements in past annual
reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat of litigation is a concern to
investors,[&lt;a href="http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" target="_blank" style
="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
)&lt;/a&gt;, who are keen to see what Barclays is doing to rebuild its brand
and restore shareholders' confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank reported an
underlying pretax profit of 4.2 billion pounds ($6.6 billion) for the six
months to the end of June,[moncler
bambino](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ), above an average forecast of 3.8
billion pounds from analysts polled by the company and up 13 percent from a
year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its shares were up 7.5 percent to 165 pence by
1248 GMT, outpacing a 1.1 percent rise by the European bank
index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it faces a bill of 450 million pounds to pay
compensation to customers misled about interest-rate hedging products to small
businesses. The figure is based on initial estimates and Barclays said the
ultimate cost is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays' investment bank fared

##  IAC loses appeal over ex-unit that went bankrupt

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI,[Moncler Sito
Ufficiale](http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/
"http://www.monclersitoufficiales.biz/" ).O), a media holding company chaired
by billionaire Barry Diller,[&lt;a href="http://www.cooses.com/"
target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Canada Goose
Jackets](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/" )&lt;/a&gt;, lost its
bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of deceiving a private equity firm into
buying a call center operator that quickly went bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday's ruling by a New York State appeals court in Manhattan is a
victory for Diamond Castle Holdings LLC, which sought $138.5 million of
damages stemming from its $277.6 million purchase of the Florida-based
operator, PRC LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said Diamond Castle could
pursue the case even though the entity it set up to actually buy PRC no longer
exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond Castle accused IAC of falsely overstating
the expected financial impact of a services contract that PRC had with Verizon
Wireless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it learned the truth only after the
November 2006 closing. PRC filed for bankruptcy protection 14 months
later,[&lt;a href="http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" target="_blank" style
="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Sac Louis
Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"
)&lt;/a&gt;, wiping out Diamond Castle's equity stake,[Canada
Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"
).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IAC argued Diamond Castle could not recover because it
formed an entity called "Panther" to buy PRC and the merger agreement barred
recovery by "third-party beneficiaries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the unanimous
five-justice appeals panel said the agreement was "plainly intended" to give
Diamond Castle enforceable rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It pointed to a provision
protecting Panther and its "affiliates" from losses caused by various
breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further,[&lt;a
href="http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" target="_blank" style="text-
decoration: none;"&gt;pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/
"http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/" )&lt;/a&gt;, it would leave plaintiffs
without remedy since Panther, the contracting entity,[sacs Louis Vuitton
Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/
"http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/" ), was merely an acquisition vehicle
which was merged into PRC immediately following the closing," the court
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IAC and Diamond Castle both are based in New York.
Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and
Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L),[scarpe moncler](http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-
moncler-c-11.html "http://www.hoocl.com/scarpe-moncler-c-11.html"

none;"&gt;[Canada Goose](http://www.cooses.com/ "http://www.cooses.com/"
)&lt;/a&gt;, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz representing IAC, said his client is
reviewing the opinion and may appeal,[&lt;a

to defend its claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond Castle spokeswoman Maureen
Connelly said the parties are now engaged in discovery,[pochette louis

).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Diamond Castle Partners IV PRC LP v.
IAC/InterActiveCorp, New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 1st
Department, No. 3694.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New
