**College Students** are post-high school team members on a [FIRST Robotics team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team" ). 

College Students are (depending on a given teams structure)
[mentors](/index.php/Mentors "Mentors" ) currently attending college, usually
for the first time. Generally (but not always) College Student mentors are
FIRST alumni and in most cases are continuing to work with the same teams as
when they were in high school, but may also participate in other teams that
may be closer to their university. Occasionally, FIRST Alumni College Students
may create a new FIRST team, typically if the area surrounding their
university does not have one already.

College Students can contribute to a team in a number of ways, usually helping
in areas related to courses they may be taking or prior FIRST experience. They
will generally work with other [mentors](/index.php/Mentors "Mentors" ) and
[engineers](/index.php/Engineers "Engineers" ) to assist
[students](/index.php/Students "Students" ) in the construction of a
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) for the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ), as well as other aspects of the team,
such as Website design, Animation, and so on.
