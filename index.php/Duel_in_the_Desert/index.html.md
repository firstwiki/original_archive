## History

The Duel in the Desert is an off season competition held by team 64, the Gila Monsters, in Gilbert, Arizona. It is a pre-ship scrimmage where teams can get practice with their robot on a practice game field. Although there are sometimes mock "matches" played for fun, there is no organized competition or awards at the event. Instead, the scrimmage focuses on giving teams driving practice, and teams are alotted practice slots where they have time to test their robot on field while other robots are also active on it.

Teams may also run their robots off of the practice field to debug and test components. The pits for teams to work on their robots have been in seperate buildings as well as the same building as the game field.

The Duel in the Desert has been running since at least 2001 (possibly earlier, more research needed), and has run through the 2005 season. There was no Duel in the 2006 season due to problems of attaining a usable game field and venue in adequate time.

The 2007 Duel in the Desert was recently announced. This year it will be hosted by team 39 (after the 2005 season, 64 split into team 39 and 1013) at Highland High School. It will not contain a full game field but will still have enough components to give valuable practice to participating teams
