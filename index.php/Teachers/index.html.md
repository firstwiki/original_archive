# Teachers

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Teachers** are usually referred to as teachers from an education institution involved with a robotics team. 

Usually teachers that are involved with a robotics team are in the Tech-Ed
department, but a teacher under any subject can be involved as having
knowledge of a technical area is helpful, but not needed.

Most teams require teachers as their team is affiliated with the school and
therefore the school requires that a teacher be present at school club
meetings and events (such as regionals or the [National
Championship](/index.php/National_Championship "National Championship" ). Some
teams may have two or more teachers to assist shaparone meetings and events so
that one teacher does not get continuously burned out and behind schedule of
his or her own classes.
