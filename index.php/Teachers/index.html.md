**Teachers** are usually referred to as teachers from an education institution involved with a robotics team.

Usually teachers that are involved with a robotics team are in the Tech-Ed department, but a teacher under any subject can be involved as having knowledge of a technical area is helpful, but not needed.

Most teams require teachers as their team is affiliated with the school and therefore the school requires that a teacher be present at school club meetings and events (such as regionals or the [National Championship](National_Championship "National Championship"). Some teams may have two or more teachers to assist shaparone meetings and events so that one teacher does not get continuously burned out and behind schedule of his or her own classes.
