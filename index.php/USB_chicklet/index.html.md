## Overview

USB-Chicklet is an embedded device that performs USB hosting on USB joysticks
and gamepads and converts the data from the device into analog and digital
signals compatible with the 15-pin joystick interface found on the [Operator
Interface](/index.php/Operator_Interface "Operator Interface" ). This allows
teams to use USB devices to control their robots without a complicated
solution.

The chicklet is powered by a 7.2-volt or 9-volt power source. This power
source can be an external power supply during practice, but the 2007 rulebook
required that a 7.2 volt battery be used during competition.
