## Overview

USB-Chicklet is an embedded device that performs USB hosting on USB joysticks and gamepads and converts the data from the device into analog and digital signals compatible with the 15-pin joystick interface found on the [Operator Interface](operator-interface). This allows teams to use USB devices to control their robots without a complicated solution.

The chicklet is powered by a 7.2-volt or 9-volt power source. This power source can be an external power supply during practice, but the 2007 rulebook required that a 7.2 volt battery be used during competition.
