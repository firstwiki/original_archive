**Soldering** connects two conductors (usually wires) using [solder](/index.php?title=Solder&action=edit "Solder" ), an [alloy](/index.php?title=Alloy&action=edit "Alloy" ) of silver (previously lead) and tin. Soldering is distinguished from welding in that the base materials to be joined are not melted. The goal when soldering is to create a joint that is both electrically conductive and strong. If a joint is not strong, it is not well connected electrically either. In addition, weak solder joints may come apart during competition or even simple handling. For the control system, this can create an electrically noisy connection which may fail sporadically, complicating future debugging of the robot.
