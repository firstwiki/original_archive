##  History

In October of 2006, the first Apple Pi Robotics meeting took place. Al Bishop,
who is related to a former student from Guilford High School, went to one of
his grandson’s robotics competitions in New Hampshire. Upon experiencing the
competition and the atmosphere it created, he knew he had to bring FIRST
Robotics to Guilford. He got another couple whose son attended Guilford High
School interested in starting a team and they approached the Metal Shop
teacher, Mr. Schaefer. Together, over the next few days, they sorted out the
details necessary in order to start a team. Fliers and announcements were
made; the first meeting was a success. The group changed drastically over the
course of the next few meetings; the people who attended changed and interests
peeked.

The team’s first project that showed their ability to work as a team was the
Savage Soccer VEX Challenge. It was indeed a challenge, as many had never
worked with VEX, or any sort of robotics, prior to joining the club. The team
entered two robots into the competition; though neither robot ranked well, the
experience was something that proved vital. Soon after the competition, the
team’s first build season for the FRC Competition began.

During the build season the team grew to appreciate engineering and designing.
For the next six weeks the team successfully completed an FRC robot and
entered it into the Hartford Regional. Though, again, the team did not rank
well in the actual competition, they were grateful and ecstatic about
receiving the Rookie All Star Award.

This award proved to be the team’s ticket to the Nationals in Atlanta, GA. The
team placed 26th out of 86 teams in their division. Elated, and with much more
experience, the team returned home to begin planning and fundraising for the
next season.
