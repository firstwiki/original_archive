This page was not working, so I copied it and tried to find the problem. It's
way down at the bottom. ({{team_index_region}} and [[Category:1257]])

    No, the team_index_region is fine. I put it back in. The category page does not work. --[SilverStar (Advay)](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 22:41, 16 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Oh, ok. When I did it, it blanked the page. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 22:48, 16 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Probably related, does anyone see the strange category tree at the bottom that
looks like this:

    
    
    Teams > 0
    Teams > 0

Fixed the problem by changing the link to Category:Team to Category:Teams.
Linking to a previously deleted category crashes pages. After I changed the
problem link in Category:1257, both the 1257 and the Category:1257 pages work
(along with all other Team 1257 pages link the team's students' pages).

For your holominic drive train, are you planning to have the omniwheels on
diagonals relative to the corners of your robot like 180 and 1083 or some
other orientation? --[Sciencewhiz](/index.php/User:Sciencewhiz
"User:Sciencewhiz" ) 14:17, 12 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    Like 180 and 1083. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:49, 12 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I noticed your team is entirely made up of juniors! Thats a bit scary,
considering ALL of you will be seniors next season...

Time to start recruiting, eh?

##  Question

How did you get the Picture and Rookie Year and all that stuff in the box to
the right? I can't figure out how to do it. :(

  
I'll convert it to teamtemplate to simplify it for you.
