Every year, [FIRST](first) makes a tradition of releasing an official hint about the upcoming season's [FIRST Robotics Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition") [game](Game "Game") before the [kickoff](Kickoff "Kickoff"). In an e-mail blast sent to all teams, FIRST indicated its official hint for the [untitled 2005 game](Untitled_2005_game "Untitled 2005 game") on December 30, 2004.
