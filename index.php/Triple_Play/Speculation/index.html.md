This page serves as a place for hints about the as of yet undisclosed 2005
game to be cataloged. Please attribute any "hints" or "leaks" to the source
from whence they came. If you are simply guessing based on historical
evidence, or your own intuition, please say so. When this game is officially
announced, the contents of this page will be moved to discussion (so we can
look back on how very, very, wrong we were). Take everything you read here
with a grain of salt.
