Field at Florida Competition

This game was the first game in which there were three robots to an alliance.
It featured pyrimidal objects made of PVC pipe as the game object, called
"tetras." The game was played on a field set up like a tic-tac-toe board, with
nine larger goal tetras in three rows. The object of the game was to place the
scoring tetras on the larger goal tetras, creating rows of three by having a
tetra of your allaince's color at the highest point on the goal. Tetras scored
on the top of a goal tetra (a larger aluminum version) were worth 3 points,
while tetras scored inside the goals were worth 1 point. Rows of three tetras
on top of the goals were worth ten points, so long as the row was there at the
end of the two minute and fifteen second match. Ten points could also be
scored if all three alliance robots were behind the starting line at their end
of the field at the end of the game.
