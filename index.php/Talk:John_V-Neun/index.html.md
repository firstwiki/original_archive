# Talk:John V-Neun

After a discussion with [Max](User:Max "User:Max"), We decided to mention both team [20](20 "20") and [250](250 "250"). JVN prefers 20, and that is what it is today. However, at the time it was 250. so if you strongly object, please state here. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 17:22, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT)

It seems like, to me anyway, John objects. He indicated to me that he wanted it to be 20 after I first wrote that page and he and I have each changed it _back_ to 20 multiple times. My feeling is that if John wanted it to be 20 and 250, he'd have edited as such. -- [Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )

I have discussed it with him. At the time he was actually a team member, the number was 250\. However, the highschool he graduated from now is team 20\. More info at [20's History](20#History "20" ). I am aware of his oppinions and of the facts. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 17:32, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Ok, two things I'd like to say: 
```

- This is a page about John, not his page (that would be User:JVN or whatever). I'm sure he knows the facts of his life better than any of us, but don't give "John said he wants it that way" as a reason. We are going for accuracy in these biographies, not pleasing the person being biographed, so "John said that's the way it is" is a better. I think we all understand the facts, it's just an argument over which number to use, the one at the time or the one now. As far as I can tell, it is only John's personal preference to use the current one; there is no actual _reason_ to not put both.
- As Astronouth said, the easiest way to resolve such an argument is mention both points.

There is no resolution when you simply ignore those who're opposing you. If John maintains that he'd like it left as team 20, it should be left as team 20 -- and team 20 alone. I think it's important that we remain respectful of those involved and their wishes -- and if that's not something that would be a matter of policy (as well as common sense), I don't see many people being bothered by contributing here; myself included. If John doesn't care, I don't care, though I think it a bit ridiculous to accept or expect "unauthorized" biographies that go against the wishes of their subjects -- [Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )





This seems like something that he is concerned about. Perhaps someone can explain the matter to me, as I appear to be quite dense today. JVN was part of team 20, but at that time its number was 250? From the history page, it appears 250 split? The only reason I can see that JVN is concerned about mentioning 250 is that there was some sort of bad blood over the split. Is this the case, or am I being blind to something more obvious? As it stands, we mention the split on team 20's history page, so why re-mention it here if we can refer to that page? It seems like a simple matter to keep a good guy happy ... especially since it doesn't sacrifice integrity or correctness (and as it stands, the mention in this article is somewhat confusing to the unaware reader). But it seems to me there's something we don't know about (or at least something I don't know about) involved ... --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:08, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



Fair enough, if John is opposed to putting both numbers, remove it. It probably is a bit presumptuous for us to take a standpoint like "truth comes first" ...so far. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:08, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



I agree. However, I've said all that I know. (I made the history section, JVN edited it.) --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 20:13, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
```

Ok, why is this becoming SUCH a big deal? Please use the [arbitration page](FIRSTwiki:Arbitration "FIRSTwiki:Arbitration") for further discussion. --[SilverStar (Advay)](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar") 20:41, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT)

```
From the arbitration page, _This page exists only to discuss and resolve issues, like "edit wars" and serious disagreements about content. Try to resolve the conflict using the specifc page's discussion/talk page._ It seems like we've reached an agreement ... but if not, I'm not sure it's quite at the stage where it should be placed on the arbitration page. It's just a friendly discussion as of now, not a serious disagreement (I'm actually trying to find out what the issue is before I agree of disagree with someone!). Also, this should be placed at the bottom of the page, since it is continuing on the thread. Otherwise it creates content that is confusing to follow (for instance, I immdediately went to the bottom of the page and almost missed your comment). --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:53, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT)
