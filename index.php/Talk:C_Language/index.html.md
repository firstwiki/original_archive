# Talk:C Language

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Is there a need for this article? It seems other sources, especially
wikipedia, would be better suited. We have a page on [Programming the Robot
Controller](Programming_the_Robot_Controller "Programming the Robot
Controller" ), on [Resources for C
programming](Resources_for_C_programming "Resources for C
programming" ), on [Programming](Programming "Programming" ) and on
[PIC C](PIC_C "PIC C" ). This seems unnecessary, and too large of a
subject to cover adequately ... --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls

    My purpose here was just to put up a few reference notes. Keywords, Physical sizes of data types, etc. I didn't mean for this to turn into any type of real guide to the C language. [Noah](User:Noah "User:Noah" )

    Well the thing is that kind of page is really covered pretty well at [Wikipedia:C programming language](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language "wikipedia:C_programming_language" ). That article also links to many other wikipedia articles that provide a truly complete set of info on C. We want to provide the best content possible, but sometimes the best way we can do that is let someone else do it for us. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 23:02, 2 Jul 2004 (EDT)
