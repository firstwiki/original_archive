## Overview

Robolab is based on National Instruments LabView. It was created by a partnership between National Instruments, Tufts University, and LEGO Dacta for use in teaching programming in a K-12 environment.

One notable point about Robolab is that is runs on both the Windows and Apple Macintosh platforms. [Mindstorms RIS](/index.php?title=Mindstorms_RIS&action=edit "Mindstorms RIS") on the other hand only runs on Windows.

## Contructs

Robolab contains all the standard programming constructs needed such as...

- Variables (called containers)
- Branches (called Forks)
- Loops (called Loops)

...as well as providing all the commands required to control the RCX and attached hardware (motors and sensors).
