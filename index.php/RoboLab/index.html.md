## Overview

Robolab is based on National Instruments LabView. It was created by a
partnership between National Instruments, Tufts University, and LEGO Dacta for
use in teaching programming in a K-12 environment.

One notable point about Robolab is that is runs on both the Windows and Apple
Macintosh platforms. [Mindstorms
RIS](/index.php?title=Mindstorms_RIS&action=edit "Mindstorms RIS" ) on the
other hand only runs on Windows.


## Contructs

Robolab contains all the standard programming constructs needed such as...

  * Variables (called containers) 
  * Branches (called Forks) 
  * Loops (called Loops) 

...as well as providing all the commands required to control the RCX and
attached hardware (motors and sensors).
