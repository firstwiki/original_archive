## Overview

Robolab is based on National Instruments LabView. It was created by a
partnership between National Instruments, Tufts University, and LEGO Dacta for
use in teaching programming in a K-12 environment.

One notable point about Robolab is that is runs on both the Windows and Apple
Macintosh platforms. [Mindstorms
RIS](/index.php?title=Mindstorms_RIS&action=edit "Mindstorms RIS" ) on the
other hand only runs on Windows.
