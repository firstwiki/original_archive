# Designing a team webpage/Guide 1

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

When designing a team webpage, the objectives of the site must be considered.
For example, do you just want to list the team members, or do you want a
forum, videos, and pictures? Your website can be the first impression someone
gets of your team, so it should be well organized, have enough content, and be
up-to-date.

There are two main functions of a FIRST team website: to tell non-members
about the team, and to provide a resource for communication and organizing
within the team. It is a good idea to try to create a seperate experience for
non-team members and team members.

  
One excellent resource all teams should consider is
[OpenFIRST](/index.php/OpenFIRST "OpenFIRST" ), an open-source project made by
[FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTer&action=edit "FIRSTer" ) specifically
designed for [FIRST Robotics Teams](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST
Robotics Team" ).

## Guidelines

Some basic guidelines for team webpages:

[[edit](/index.php?title=Designing_a_team_webpage/Guide_1&action=edit&section=
2 "Edit section: Well Organized" )]

### Well Organized

  * One main navgation bar 
  * Can go from one page to another, without going through index 
  * Maybe a search box 


### Compatibility

  * Design your website with browsers other then Internet Explorer in mind. 
  * Test it with other browsers such as Firefox and Opera before finishing. 
  * Don't use things that will only work on windows computers or require multiple plugin downloads. 
  * Active-X is bad! Its full of holes, try and stay away from it. 


### Content

  * Imagine your website as just plain text, would it still be worth visiting? It should be! 
  * History of the team (how it was founded, etc) 
  * History of robots and awards won 
  * Links to press coverage 
  * Links to your sponsors 
  * When possible, link to general FIRST sites (like [FIRSTwiki](/index.php/FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki" ), or the official FIRST site) instead of trying to explain everything yourself. 
  * An excellent way to keep your team/mentors/parents/sponsors coordinated is through a forum system. See [Creating a forum](/index.php?title=Creating_a_forum&action=edit "Creating a forum" ).

5 "Edit section: Imagery" )]

### Imagery

  * ALWAYS Do content before beauty 
  * Save images as .gif or .png at a quality that preserves the image but saves space. Do not use jpeg images for the background images of the site, as they are very lossy. 
  * Choose a cohesive color scheme to use throughout the website. Ideally, these colors relate with the team in some way. 
  * Use contrasting colors to emphasize your message, while making sure to stay within the color scheme. 
  * Be tasteful in your use of graphics by learning important design principles involving typography, layout, and color. 


### Timeliness

  * Continuously update your site. 
  * Nothing is worse than having "Just updated: 2002's awards!" in big letters on your homepage, after the end of the 2004 competition. 


## Software

8 "Edit section: CMSs" )]

### CMSs

Content Management Software (CMS) can be very useful for a team website. They
make setting up basic news, discussion board, gallery and other functionality
a matter of uploading files via FTP and running some install files. Of course,
if the user chooses, there is plenty of opportunity for expansion.

  * [OpenFIRST](/index.php/OpenFIRST "OpenFIRST" ) \- a set of modules for FIRST teams to make or enhance sites. 
  * [PHP-Nuke](http://phpnuke.org/ "http://phpnuke.org/" )

  * [Plone](http://plone.org "http://plone.org" )
  * [vBulletin](http://www.vbulletin.com/ "http://www.vbulletin.com/" ) \- Software that [ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" ) uses. Not free.
