# Designing a team webpage/Guide 1

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

When designing a team webpage, the objectives of the site must be considered. For example, do you just want to list the team members, or do you want a forum, videos, and pictures? Your website can be the first impression someone gets of your team, so it should be well organized, have enough content, and be up-to-date.

There are two main functions of a FIRST team website: to tell non-members about the team, and to provide a resource for communication and organizing within the team. It is a good idea to try to create a seperate experience for non-team members and team members.

One excellent resource all teams should consider is [OpenFIRST](OpenFIRST "OpenFIRST"), an open-source project made by [FIRSTers](/index.php?title=FIRSTer&action=edit "FIRSTer") specifically designed for [FIRST Robotics Teams](FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST
Robotics Team").

## Guidelines

Some basic guidelines for team webpages:

2 "Edit section: Well Organized")]

### Well Organized

- One main navgation bar
- Can go from one page to another, without going through index
- Maybe a search box

### Compatibility

- Design your website with browsers other then Internet Explorer in mind.
- Test it with other browsers such as Firefox and Opera before finishing.
- Don't use things that will only work on windows computers or require multiple plugin downloads.
- Active-X is bad! Its full of holes, try and stay away from it.

### Content

- Imagine your website as just plain text, would it still be worth visiting? It should be!
- History of the team (how it was founded, etc)
- History of robots and awards won
- Links to press coverage
- Links to your sponsors
- When possible, link to general FIRST sites (like [FIRSTwiki](FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki"), or the official FIRST site) instead of trying to explain everything yourself.
- An excellent way to keep your team/mentors/parents/sponsors coordinated is through a forum system. See [Creating a forum](/index.php?title=Creating_a_forum&action=edit "Creating a forum").

5 "Edit section: Imagery")]

### Imagery

- ALWAYS Do content before beauty
- Save images as .gif or .png at a quality that preserves the image but saves space. Do not use jpeg images for the background images of the site, as they are very lossy.
- Choose a cohesive color scheme to use throughout the website. Ideally, these colors relate with the team in some way.
- Use contrasting colors to emphasize your message, while making sure to stay within the color scheme.
- Be tasteful in your use of graphics by learning important design principles involving typography, layout, and color.

### Timeliness

- Continuously update your site.
- Nothing is worse than having "Just updated: 2002's awards!" in big letters on your homepage, after the end of the 2004 competition.

## Software

8 "Edit section: CMSs")]

### CMSs

Content Management Software (CMS) can be very useful for a team website. They make setting up basic news, discussion board, gallery and other functionality a matter of uploading files via FTP and running some install files. Of course, if the user chooses, there is plenty of opportunity for expansion.

- [OpenFIRST](OpenFIRST "OpenFIRST") - a set of modules for FIRST teams to make or enhance sites.
