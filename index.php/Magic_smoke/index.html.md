# Magic smoke

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Magic smoke** is a running joke among [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) [teams](/index.php/Teams "Teams" ) that originated among electrical [engineers](/index.php/Engineer "Engineer" ) and technicians. The magic smoke refers to the toxic fumes released during an electrical [short circuit](/index.php/Short_circuit "Short circuit" ) inside electrical components such as [motors](/index.php/Motors "Motors" ) and [electronics](/index.php/Electronics_and_circuitry "Electronics and circuitry" ).

###  History

In the joke, magic smoke is believed to live inside of
[electronics](/index.php/Electronics_and_circuitry "Electronics and circuitry"
), and is responsible for making them work. A wizard packs in the magic smoke
at the factory using arcane and near forgotten magics. When the smoke is
released, the spirits of the circuitry cause it to no longer work. This is
why, for instance, when a motor starts releasing magic smoke, it will no
longer function properly.
