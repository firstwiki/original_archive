## History

The RoboManiacs team was formed in 2003 from members of the robotics program
in the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Harford County. That rookie team had a great
year, qualifying for the FLL International Invitational in Atlanta as the
Director's Award runner-up in New Jersey. In addition the team was named
Director's Award Runner-Up at the Delaware state tournament later in the year.

For the No Limits season, 4 members left the team and 5 new ones were added.
The team took the Director's Award at the Maryland State tournament in January
2005. In February 2005, the team traveled to Orlando, Florida for the Boys
&amp; Girls Clubs of America - FLL National Championships. Against the top
Boys &amp; Girls Club teams from around the country, the team took the Robot
Performance award &amp; the Director's Award.

Representing the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, the team traveled to the
FLL World Festival in Atlanta. Although the robot did not perform as well as
we had hoped, the team was thrilled to receive the Director's Award at the
event. This meant that we finished the No Limits season as the 2005 FLL World
Champions.

Latest News for Ocean Odyssey Season: Robomaniacs took 7th place in the
European Championships. There was a total of 52 teams from all over the world
that competed in this event. The team worked hard and diligently at it and the
results were firm seventh. They did very well and they showed great team work.
