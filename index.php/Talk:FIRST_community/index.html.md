# Talk:FIRST community

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Is the meta wiki toc really appropriate here? This is supposed to be an
article describing the FIRST community ... the meta stuff isn't for general
consumption, and doesn't really relate to the FIRST community at large. Just a
humble suggestion ... I only refrain from removing it myself, because I
currently don't have the time to add more content (just finished graduation,
haha!). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 16:55, 12 Jun 2004

    agree and removed. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:56, 12 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    

    Sorry, I thought it was apropriate, but wasn't entirely sure. My bad! --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 19:06, 12 Jun 2004 (EDT)
