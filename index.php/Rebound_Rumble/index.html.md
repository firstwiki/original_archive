The Rebound RumbleSM robotics game is played between two Alliances of three
teams each. Each Alliance competes by trying to score as many of the
basketballs in the hoops as possible during the 2-minute and 15-second match.
Balls scored in higher hoops score Alliances more points. Alliances are
awarded bonus points if they are balanced on bridges at the end of the match.
In matches where opponent Alliances work together to balance on the white
bridge, all participating teams earn additional valuable seeding points.
