I'm pretty sure large regionals have 16 alliances instead of 8\. I'm not a good writer though. --[Piotrm](User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm") 22:50, 28 May 2004 (EDT)

No, always 8 alliances, and I cite a rule: 
```

At the end of the Qualification Rounds, the top eight ranked teams will become the Alliance Leads. The top ranked Alliances will be designated, in order, Alliance One, Alliance Two, etc., down to Alliance Eight. Alliances One through Eight may invite any team below them in the rankings, that has not already declined an invitation, to join their alliance. The Alliance Selection Process will consist of two rounds so that each of the eight playoff alliances consists of three teams. --[SilverStar](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar") 22:51, 28 May 2004 (EDT)

 Would you say the FIRST people at the Canadian Regional broke their own rules? Or could it be that perhaps the people who wrote the manual forgot about 16 alliance regionals? --[Piotrm](User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm" ) 23:23, 28 May 2004 (EDT) 

what are you saying, that the Canadian Regional had 16 alliances? --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" )

Yes. Take a look at the eight finals on the [results](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Events/ON/matches.html "http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Events/ON/matches.html" ) page. --[Piotrm](User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm" ) 00:30, 29 May 2004 (EDT)
