I'm pretty sure large regionals have 16 alliances instead of 8. I'm not a good
writer though. \--[Piotrm](/index.php/User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm" ) 22:50, 28

    No, always 8 alliances, and I cite a rule: 

At the end of the Qualification Rounds, the top eight ranked teams will become
the Alliance Leads. The top ranked Alliances will be designated, in order,
Alliance One, Alliance Two, etc., down to Alliance Eight. Alliances One
through Eight may invite any team below them in the rankings, that has not
already declined an invitation, to join their alliance. The Alliance Selection
Process will consist of two rounds so that each of the eight playoff alliances
consists of three teams. \--[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar

     Would you say the FIRST people at the Canadian Regional broke their own rules? Or could it be that perhaps the people who wrote the manual forgot about 16 alliance regionals? --[Piotrm](/index.php/User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm" ) 23:23, 28 May 2004 (EDT) 

    what are you saying, that the Canadian Regional had 16 alliances? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" )

    Yes. Take a look at the eight finals on the [results](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Events/ON/matches.html "http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Events/ON/matches.html" ) page. --[Piotrm](/index.php/User:Piotrm "User:Piotrm" ) 00:30, 29 May 2004 (EDT)
