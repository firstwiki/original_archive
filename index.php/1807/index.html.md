## Current Year

Allentown High School's "Redbird Robotics" is ready to play the 2012 FIRST game, Rebound Rumble. We'll be competing in the new [Mid Atlantic Robotics](http://mar.us.com "http://mar.us.com") region, competing at the Chestnut Hill district event March 9-10 (week 2), and the Lenape district event March 24-25 (week 4).

We'll be posting information about our latest robot and team shortly.

## History

Allentown High School's "Redbird Robotics" formed in 2005, taking advantage of the pre-rookie concept and tremendous mentoring support from teams [25](25 "25"), [293](293 "293") and [1089](1089 "1089") to help get us started with a solid foundation.

We joined the FIRST community in 2006 as Team 1807, and competed in the New Jersey Regional. We were named Rookie All-Star, not necessarily for our semi- final finish, but by embracing FIRST principles of working with other teams to exhibit gracious professionalism. This entitled us to go to Atlanta and compete in the Championships, an experience we'll never forget.

The team built upon its Rookie All-Star initial season with FIRST with an even more accomplished sophomore effort. In the summer leading up to the 2007 season, several motivated students took an on-line NASA course in robotics to learn about new components. This translated into having the ability to design and build a much more complex machine than our rookie robot. We utilized 8 motors (compared to 3 in 2006) to control the 4-wheel drive, 3-tiered lift mechanism, rotating arm, and claw that was needed to grasp and place large inner tubes onto the rack in the 2007 FIRST game called "Rack-n-Roll". The students learned how to use computer-aided design software to graphically render their ideas prior to cutting materials. More students became involved in programming, and incorporated an on-board camera to serve as the vision system to find the target while operating autonomously. Yet with all this complexity, we maintained our design principles of not over-engineering the product, and ensuring that the things we did, we did well.

At the New Jersey Regional, we finished qualifying rounds as the 8th seed, and made it to the quarter-finals. We were fortunate to compete in a second regional, in New York City, by virtue of the generous corporate sponsorships we received from several companies. There, we finished in 4th place, and made it to the semi-finals. And when awards were given out, the team received the Motorola Quality Award, which celebrates machine robustness in concept and fabrication, for setting the quality standard for FIRST – we were thrilled!

In our third year, we had already had a good amount of experience, but wanted to take our robot to the next level. Overall, the build season ran very smoothly. We spent the first week discussing strategies, discovering what would be most advantageous to implement. The team decided upon a six-wheel drive system using four omni-directional wheels. We felt that the omni-wheels would provide the necessary turning that Overdrive entailed. The team chose to go with a robot that could maneuver well while being able to lift a trackball, possibly even to hurdle. We went with a similar design to the prior year's robot, employing the same basic lift system that could allow for hurdling. Our robot featured several new systems for this season. We used pneumatics to contract arms that would pick up the trackball, something we had kept off the robots in years past. A new on-board computer was used to control the camera, and an ultrasonic range finder was used for obstacle avoidance. These new sensors were instrumental in design an efficient hybrid period. However, some things never change- like our trusty system of 80/20 and Lexan plating, which really cut down on the weight. We even had time to test and debug any problems with the robot, something we ran out of time for in the last two seasons.

In our 4th year, Redbird Robotics continued our tradition of preparing our new team members for the rigor of the FIRST build season by participating in post- season events such as Brunswick Eruption, and simulating a mini-build season by building a functioning robot chassis using old parts. We again went to the New Jersey and New York City Regionals to compete in the 2009 game, Lunacy. We finally built a robot that could "shoot", and made improvements between the regionals that took our robot to the ultimate level: partnering with teams [56](56 "56") and [1796](/index.php?title=1796&action=edit "1796"), we won the NYC Regional! We headed back to Atlanta, and held our own on the Archimedes field to finish with a 4-3 record. In the post-season, we started training a new drive team at both Monty Madness and Brunswick Eruption, and finally earned our first Tiki award by reaching the BE8 finals!

In year 5, we moved into the Ag Mechanic building at the school for our build season work. With some new mentors and students leading the effort, we again built a robot that could compete with the best of them! We brainstormed ideas during our first few weeks, deciding on a fast, strong and highly maneuverable robot that could quickly move into any of the zones to impact the game play. We have 8 wheels, including omni-directional wheels in the corners, that give us a small turning radius. These are powered by 4 motors to give us speed and power. Our extruded aluminum 80/20 chassis is elevated to enable us to climb over the bumps. To manipulate the ball, we prototyped various configurations during the build season, starting with pneumatics, transitioning to motor- driven winch and rubber-tubing "spring", and ending up with a hybrid of these designs. A pneumatic actuator will force the kicker back against the resistance of the tubing, until it is held in ready position by a gate latch. Another actuator will release the latch, sending the kicker foot forward to kick the ball. Since the rules require that the foot not be extended beyond the frame for more than 2 seconds, the pneumatics will immediately retract and re-latch the kicker. This is only the 2nd time in our team's 5 year history that pneumatics have been employed, and I'm proud to say that our students have built quite an incredible mechanism! To ensure the ball is in position to kick the ball, a roller mechanism keeps the ball in "possession" of the robot as we move around the field to align it with the goal. We're hoping to improve on this design during the post-season. Our programming team used the Java language for the first time to control our robot. The driver used a Playstation game controller, and the kicker-operator will be strumming a Guitar Hero to send signals to the robot (really!).

At the 2010 NJ Regional, we played tough defense during all of our matches, and pushed many balls through the goals as we maneuvered around the field by going through tunnels. Many of these match videos are available on TBA at <http://thebluealliance.net/tbatv/team/1807/2010>. We finished the competition with 7 straight wins!

Check out this 2011 article in local paper [The Examiner](http://examiner.gmne
ws.com/news/2011-02-24/Front_Page/Redbirds_ready_to_rock_with_their_robot.html "http://examiner.gmnews.com/news/2011-02-24/Front_Page/Redbirds_ready_to_rock_
with_their_robot.html") which details our accomplishments in the 2011 FIRST game LogoMotion.

In addition to the backing we receive from corporate sponsors, the school is well-supported by the school. The teacher receives a stipend for his participation, and we have room in the school to store our materials and build our robot. Next fall, we'll be moving to a new facility! The high school has introduce Robotics into the curriculum as a result of our team. The community has embraced the team as well. We have participated in the annual Harvest Festival, a 2-day street fair where we enable youngsters to drive our robot; a community event called Petz Gone Wild, we've marched in the Memorial Day Parade; and we've worked with future team members at the elementary school's Science Night and at the Allentown Public Library, showing them how we design and build a robot.
