"Advisor" is an instructor. "Adviser" is a coach. --[SilverStar](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar") 18:06, 29 May 2004 (EDT)

What's the difference between a team advisor and a team mentor? --[199.46.200.230](/index.php?title=User:199.46.200.230&action=edit "User:199.46.200.230") 18:37, 21 Jun 2004 (EDT)

It seems that the mentor page focusses more on engineers and this is the general case. Though I agree with you, that there isn't really a distinction. A mentor's role includes advice, and mentoring surely isn't limited to teaching shop. Hrm... for a group of pages so integral to FIRST (mentors/advisor, students, teachers, etc.), -- there sure isn't a lot written. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 18:48, 21 Jun 2004 (EDT)
