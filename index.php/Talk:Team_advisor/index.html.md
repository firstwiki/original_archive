"Advisor" is an instructor. "Adviser" is a coach.

What's the difference between a team advisor and a team mentor?

    It seems that the mentor page focusses more on engineers and this is the general case. Though I agree with you, that there isn't really a distinction. A mentor's role includes advice, and mentoring surely isn't limited to teaching shop. Hrm... for a group of pages so integral to FIRST (mentors/advisor, students, teachers, etc.), -- there sure isn't a lot written. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 18:48, 21 Jun 2004 (EDT)
