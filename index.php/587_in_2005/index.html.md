## Robot

**OCCAM 5** was a mix of the good and the bad. It was great at defense, but slow at offense. The drivetrain was a simple one-speed jobbie with four [CIMs](CIM "CIM" ) and big pneumatic tires. The arm, however had issues caused partly by its own simplicity. HDPE squares were used to reduce friction in the motor powered telescoping mechanism, which turned out to be a bad choice. The HDPE swelled in the humid Atlanta air, causing the arm to seize and fail at the [Championship](The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event" ). The arm also had other problems due to accidental use of thinner PVC pipe for test tetras and gear ratio calculation at home.
