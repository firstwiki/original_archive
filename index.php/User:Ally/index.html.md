... is the sexiest woman alive

My contributions to team [1257](1257 "1257" ) have been my bloodied
fingers and ragged fingernails. Jason and I made every single purple button
that we have given away at competitions. All 1000 of them.

I also do public relations, flirt with Brazilian robotics teams, cannot turn
on computers, and buy the best afterschool-robotics meeting-snacks in the
entire universe.

I was driven to the hospital in a coach bus at the Annapolis, MD regional
after having a terrible allergic reaction to maryland shellfish and sprouting
hives all over my body that transformed me into a a half-turtle half-
womanthing.

I hate electronics and sharp pointed objects but I am looking foward to
competing again next year!
