## Constable's Lock for sale, seen worth $30-40 million

LONDON (Reuters) - One of British artist John Constable's most important paintings, "The Lock", will go under the hammer at Christie's in London on July 3 and is expected to raise 20-25 million pounds (around $30-40 million), the auctioneer said on Tuesday.

The Lock is one of a celebrated series of six large-scale canvases that also includes "The Hay Wain",[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), arguably his most famous work that hangs in Britain's National Gallery in London.

The Lock is also the last of the series still in private hands, and is being offered from the private collection of Baroness Carmen Thyssen Bornemisza.

The painting has been sold only once since it was acquired from the artist,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), raising 10.8 million pounds at auction in 1990 making it the most valuable British painting ever sold at the time -- a record it held for 16 years.

The current auction record for a British painting is, most experts agree, $86.3 million for a 1976 Francis Bacon triptych sold in 2008.

Bacon was born in Ireland, but is often described as British due to his English parentage and the fact that he spent much of his life in London.

"This superb landscape, coming from the same series as The Hay Wain, represents British landscape painting at its very best and is sure to attract bidding from museums and collectors from all over the world,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/")," said Jussi Pylkkanen,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), president of Christie's Europe, Middle East, Russia and India.

The Lock was completed in 1824,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), one of the most important years in Constable's career which saw The Hay Wain exhibited at the Paris Salon and King Charles X of France award him a gold medal.

Constable's success in France has been seen by many experts as a factor in inspiring French artists in a movement of landscape painting that would find its fullest expression some five decades later in the work of the Impressionists.

The Lock is a landscape depicting a man at a lock with a boat on the river just behind him, set under a towering tree and a dramatic, cloud-filled sky.

## Madonna's brother to publish book on life with her

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pop star Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone has written a memoir called "Life With My Sister Madonna,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/")," to be published next month by Simon and Schuster.

"Ciccone's extraordinary memoir is based on his life and 47 years of growing up with and working with his sister -- the most famous woman in the world," Simon and Schuster imprint Simon Spotlight Entertainment said.

Ciccone,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/"), one of Madonna's five siblings,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), wrote the book with Wendy Leigh. She has also written biographies of John F. Kennedy Jr,[Gucci Bags](http://www
.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), Britain's Prince Edward, Liza Minelli and ghost-written Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography.

Madonna's spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg had no comment.

Madonna, whose original name was Madonna Louise Ciccone, made her debut in

1. Her first album,[Louis Vuitton Online](http://www.louisvuittononline-
  sale.com/ "http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/"), "Madonna," which included hits such as "Holiday," "Borderline" and "Lucky Star," helped her become one of the best-selling pop artists,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), with more than 200 million albums sold worldwide.

The book will be published on July 15, a month before Madonna celebrates her 50th birthday.

## Gosh! Famous Five get 21st Century makeover

LONDON (Reuters) - One of Britain's best-known children's book series,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), Enid Blyton's "Famous Five," has been turned into a 21st century cartoon -- to a mixed reception from purists.

The "lashings" of ginger beer and cream buns have gone, replaced with mobile phones, laptops, iPods and pizza, as the five teenagers follow in their parents' daring footsteps.

As the children of the original heroes Julian, Dick,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), Anne and George,[Louis Vuitton Online](http://www
.louisvuittononline-sale.com/ "http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/"), the new adventurers set about catching fake environmentalists, rather than kidnappers and smugglers -- along with Timmy the dog.

Almost seven decades after Blyton created the child detectives, the characters are being revived in a new Disney Channel cartoon, "Famous Five On the Case," along with a book series.

Critics have long branded her books sexist, racist and overly simplistic, but Blyton's stories are still hugely popular, selling more than 10 million copies a year, drawing readers into a bygone world of carefree kids and "beastly" grown-ups.

The new series,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), in association with Chorion which holds the titles' rights, was given the green light by Blyton's eldest daughter, Gillian Baverstock just before she died last year.

But Vivienne Endecott, from the Enid Blyton Society, said she was "wary" about the makeover.

"Anybody can write about four children and a dog and my concern is that kids who watch this will think that the Famous Five is all about gadgets and multiculturalism," she told newspapers.

The new series stars Anglo-Indian Jo -- George's daughter whose full name "Jyoti" is Hindu for light -- who, like her mother, is a proud tomboy, and loves the outdoors.

Next is 13 year-old Max,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), Julian's son, an avid mountain biker and skater. Anne's daughter, Allie, 12, is a Californian who loves shopping and sending text messages.

Dylan,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), 11, the son of Dick, is a gadget nerd and aspiring businessman who follows the stock market on his laptop.

"The Famous Five themes of adventure, mystery and friendship are as relevant and appealing to kids today as they were 70 years ago," said the Disney Channel's Steve Aranguren in a statement.

Blyton, who penned nearly 700 books ranging from The Famous Five and Secret Seven series to Noddy, was the best-selling English-language author of the 20th century and has sold about 400 million copies. She died in 1968.

The new 26-part series starts in May.

## Charlie Sheen bombs in Detroit debacle

DETROIT (Hollywood Reporter) - Call it tiger blood or Adonis DNA if you will. Just don't call it entertainment.

Kicking off his 20-city tour April 2 in Detroit, Charlie Sheen pulled a stunt that even by his standards was a little extreme. He alternately pandered to and antagonized an estimated audience of 5,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"),000 people at the Fox Theater in a blatantly cynical attempt to cash in on his craziness. Roughly paraphrased, his excuse for having barely worked out the blueprint for an act was, "Hey, you guys paid for a show when you didn't know what you were getting!"

What the audience got was egomania gone wild. Grandiosely titled "My Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat is Not an Option," Sheen's haphazard act was neither standup nor confessional memoir, despite repeated promises that he was going to dig deep and dish secrets. It was closer to a motivational seminar, but one in which the speaker was also the key beneficiary. Early in the evening, before the crowd turned sour, there was a creepy atmosphere that suggested group indoctrination into a cult.

The audience was packed with beer-guzzling fans who cheered Sheen on at first as he benignly nodded approval of the girl-on-girl lip-lock from his "goddesses," two Christina Aguilera clones who promptly disappeared.

The crowd remained somewhat supportive as Sheen launched into a rant that began with, "They took my awesome children. They took my sometimes groovy job. They tried to take my brain and my heart and my titanium spine." There were promises of "A night of pure magic, a night of winning." But despite Sheen's assurance several times, that things were about to get radical,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), they just got boring. When you pledge to unlock the Vatican assassin inside each and every audience member, you better deliver something.

What Sheen delivered was the overwritten, faux-Biblical preaching of a self- anointed Messiah, who views himself as the most truthful person in the universe. Maybe, but not this universe. He opened up to audience questions and then deflected most of them as too lame to merit his attention, the chief exception being from a young woman who requested to come up onstage for a hug.

Whether Sheen was thrown off by the steadily increasing hostility in the audience is unclear. But the impression is that beyond the video content that made up more than 50% of his 70 minutes of stage time, there didn't appear to be much of a plan. The Two and a Half Men debacle was referenced only in one or two indirect swipes.

Sure,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), some of the video mashups and rap tributes were funny,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), but there was little that can't be enjoyed while surfing Youtube. And the scratch remix with comic inserts of Sheen's GMA interview with Andrea Canning was a succession of self-serving cheap shots. Irrespective of the vague information supplied about the show in advance, it seems dishonest to promise a night of soul-baring and deliver a lot of rehashed Web fodder.

There's a certain trainwreck fascination in watching a meltdown in progress, but this anthropological study of the homo loco species wore very thin very fast. And Sheen appears to have known it. As the booing, and the shouts of "Loser" and "You suck" grew more insistent, and the walkouts increased, he said he would take a music break and return when the crowd woke up. Rather than the rumored guest appearance of Snoop Dogg, rapper Simon Rex appeared and barked a little, followed by Snoop performing on video. The possibility of Snoop appearing in person was nil, as he was performing with kids TV band Big Time Rush at Nickelodeon's Kids Choice Awards in Los Angeles at the time.

Afterward, Sheen did not return (reports that he reappeared on stage after the end are false). House lights came up. No bow. Show's over. Half the audience sat there looking stunned for a time,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), watching the road crew clear the stage. On the way out, I overheard someone say,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/"), "Dude, that was seriously the worst thing I've ever witnessed."

The opening montage that introduced the star threaded together clips of his father Martin Sheen in Apocalypse Now with images from Jaws, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Dirty Harry, Die Hard, Carlito's Way, National Lampoon's Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, giving a pretty clear indication of how Charlie Sheen sees himself these days. That would be warrior, law enforcer, killer, psychopath and party animal. But this thrown-together, insanely self- indulgent showcase merely reveals someone far more sad and delusional.

## Ai Weiwei endured immense pressure in detention source

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei, whose disappearance in April caused an international outcry, endured intense psychological pressure during 81 days in secretive detention and still faces the threat of prison for alleged subversion, a source familiar with the events told Reuters.

In the first broad account of Ai's treatment in detention since he was released in June, the source,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), who declined to be identified fearing retribution, said the 54-year-old artist was interrogated more than 50 times by police, while he was held in two secret locations.

The questioning focused on his purported role in the planned Arab-inspired "Jasmine Revolution" protests in China in February and his writings that could constitute subversion, said the source.

That account runs counter to the Chinese government's repeated statements that Ai's detention was based on alleged economic crimes.

"What you're doing is illegal," Ai told police officers at one point, according to the source. "They said: 'Do you know before Liu Shaoqi died, he was holding the constitution...Talk about illegality, there's no difference between the country that we are in now and the time of the Cultural Revolution."

Liu, a former president, was purged and died in prison during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when paramount leader Mao Zedong turned against his comrades in the name of radical upheaval.

In the second location, where Ai was held for 67 days, the artist famed for his work on the "Bird's Nest" Olympic Stadium in Beijing,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), was watched over by two police officers for 24 hours a day, with their faces often inches from his, watching his every movement even while his slept.

Ai had to ask the police officers for permission to drink water and use the toilet. He was not allowed to speak and was watched over by the officers even while he slept. They demanded that he put his hands on top of the blanket, the source said.

"It was immense psychological pressure," the source said.

Under the conditions of Ai's release, he is not allowed to be interviewed by journalists, meet with foreigners, use the Internet and interact with human rights advocates for a year from his release, the source said.

Despite this, the burly artist, with flecks of grey in his distinctive beard, has spoken out on his Twitter account for detained dissidents and his associates who had disappeared during the time that he did but have since been released.

During his detention, Ai was fed well and allowed long walks, the source said.

Ai has long been an outspoken government critic, and for a long time, many believed Ai had been somewhat protected by his fame and by being the son of a famed Communist poet,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/"), Ai Qing.

But when Ai was taken from the airport by plainclothes officers on April 3, they covered his head with a black hood, put him in a car and drove him to a secluded location,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), the source said.

Ai was told that he was being put under "residential surveillance." He asked whether he could have access to a lawyer or whether his family knew of his whereabouts, and police officers told him that could take up to six months.

While he was held, the source said,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), Ai was asked whether he knew who the organisers of the "Jasmine" protests were. Ai denied all knowledge, the source said.

Police officers discussed the contents of his blog and Twitter account, "line by line," the source said.

He was told he could face 10 years in prison for "inciting subversion to state power" -- a broad charge that China often uses to punish dissidents.

On the day he was released, police officers told him he "could still be sentenced to 10 years," the source said, adding that Ai had to sign a contract stating that he would agree to the terms of his release before he could be released.

"OBSCENE PERSON"

Ai's detention ignited an outcry from many Western governments about China's tightening grip on dissent that started in February, when dozens of rights activists and dissidents were detained and arrested.

The artist was the most internationally well-known of those detained, and his family has repeatedly said he was targeted by authorities for his outspoken criticism of censorship and Communist Party controls.

During the nearly three months of detention, his family and friends said his whereabouts were unknown. Ai met his wife Lu Qing once at a time when rumors circulated that he was being tortured.

When Ai was released on bail in late June, the Chinese government said he remained under investigation for suspicion of economic crimes, including tax evasion. Ai told Reuters earlier that he has not received a formal notice from the authorities to explain the charge of "suspected economic crimes."

Police officers told Ai "you criticised the government, so we are going to let all society know that you're an obscene person, you evaded taxes, you have two wives, we want to shame you. We'll not use politics to deal with you," the source said.

The source said Ai told them "no one is going to believe you," but officers told him "everyone will believe us, tax evasion is a very serious crime in many countries."

Despite the intimidation, Ai is unlikely to leave the country for good, the source said. He had confirmed earlier to Reuters that he had accepted a visiting teaching post at the Berlin University of the Arts and that he would like to go to Germany, if given permission by the authorities. [ID:nLDE76C14I].

Ai will not abandon his once prominent role as a free speech advocate, the source said. On Tuesday, Ai tweeted that if people do not speak out for dissidents Wang Lihong and Ran Yunfei, they do "not stand for fairness and justice...and have no self-respect."

On Monday, he tweeted about the conditions of four associates who had been detained at the same time as Ai,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), saying "they innocently suffered immense mental devastation and physical torment."

## Barnes wins Booker Prize he once named posh bingo

LONDON (Reuters) - English author and bookmakers' favorite Julian Barnes finally won the Man Booker Prize for fiction on Tuesday, despite once dismissing the coveted award as "posh bingo."

The 65-year-old triumphed with "The Sense of an Ending," which at 150 pages was described by one review as a "novella."

It was his fourth time on the Booker shortlist -- Barnes was previously nominated for "Flaubert's Parrot" in 1984, "England, England" in 1998 and "Arthur and George" in 2005.

Stella Rimington,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/"), a former British spy chief who chaired the panel of judges this year, told reporters, "We thought that it was a book which, though short, was incredibly concentrated, and crammed into this very short space a great deal of information you don't get out of a first reading.

"It's one of these books,[Louis Vuitton Online](http://www.louisvuittononline-
sale.com/ "http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/"), a very readable book,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), if I may use that word, but readable not only once but twice and even three times."

Ion Trewin, administrator of the prize, said it was not the shortest work to win the Booker. That honor goes to Penelope Fitzgerald's "Offshore" which came in at 132 pages in 1979.

Barnes, who has been critical of the prize in the past, said he was relieved to have won at the fourth attempt.

In his acceptance speech at a glitzy awards ceremony in London's medieval Guildhall, he likened himself to Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, considered one of the greatest authors never to have won the Nobel Prize in Literature.

"Borges, when asked, as he continually was, why he had never won the Nobel Prize, always used to reply that 'In Sweden there was a small cottage industry solely devoted to not giving Borges the Nobel Prize'.

"And at times over the last years, in occasional moments of mild paranoia, I wondered whether there wasn't perhaps some similar sister organization operating over here.

"So I am as much relieved as I am delighted to receive the 2011 Booker Prize."

SALES BOOST EXPECTED

Barnes received a check for 50,000 pounds ($80,000),[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), a flurry of media attention and,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), perhaps most importantly, a major boost in sales.

"Writers it tends to drive mad with hope and lust and greed and expectation," he told reporters after receiving the award.

"I was saying that the best way to stay sane is to treat it as if it's posh bingo. That is ... until you win it, when you realize that the judges are the wisest heads in literary Christendom."

Rimington and her judges came under fire in recent weeks for stressing the importance of "readability" when judging the winner, a term interpreted by some as dumbing down one of English-language fiction's top accolades.

Writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe are eligible.

The sniping in the narrow world of British "literati" even led to a rival award being set up to champion what its backers said was a more high-brow approach to writing.

Rimington defended her stance, arguing that entertainment and literary criticism were not mutually exclusive.

"We were not talking about only readability as some of you seem to have thought," she told reporters.

"We were talking about readability and quality. You can have more than one adjective when you are talking about books."

Asked whether she had been bothered by the media debate in the run-up to the announcement, she replied:

"I've had a long life in various different careers, and I've been through many crises of one kind or another (against) which this one pales, I must say."

The Sense of an Ending, published by Random House, tells the story of Tony,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), a seemingly ordinary man who discovers that his memories are not as reliable as he thought.

This year Barnes was up against Carol Birch for "Jamrach's Menagerie," Canadian authors Patrick deWitt and Esi Edugyan for "The Sisters Brothers" and "Half Blood Blues" respectively, and debut British novelists Stephen Kelman ("Pigeon English") and A.D. Miller ("Snowdrops").

## Matisse bronze could fetch $35 million at auction

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A life-size bronze sculpture by Henri Matisse, which has never been sold at auction, is expected to be the star of the autumn art sales and could fetch up to $35 million, art experts said.

Matisse's "Back IV (Nu de Dos, 4eme etat)," circa 1930 is being sold at Christie's on November 3 by a private European collector, whom the auction house declined to name.

But Christie's said the owner recognizes the tremendous market opportunity for modern sculpture at this time.

"Conceived on an epic scale, Back IV is a powerfully reductive expression of the human form that stands as a milestone in the evolution of modernist style," said Conor Jordan,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), the head of Impressionist and Modern Art for Christie's Americas.

Another life-size sculpture, Alberto Giacometti's "Walking Man I," briefly became the most expensive work ever auctioned in February when it sold for more than $104 million.

Another Giacometti and a sculpture by Amedeo Modigliani each sold for more than $50 million this year.

Christie's is expected to announce the Matisse sale publicly this week.

The Matisse work is the last of a series of four sculptures that Jordan described as Matisse's most ambitious project, which the artist worked on for more than 20 years.

Twelve bronzes were produced of each piece in the series.

"As our upcoming sale represents the first time that any of the Back sculptures has ever been offered at auction, we expect tremendous enthusiasm from collectors around the world who will recognize this superb bronze as one of the most important sculptural achievements of the 20th century,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/")," he explained.

Apart from its rarity, intense interest in the sale is expected following the enthusiastic response to the "Matisse: Radical Invention" exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) which is ending soon.

All four of its "Back" sculptures were moved from MOMA's sculpture garden to its galleries, where they were among the show's focal points.

In May Christie's sold the most expensive work ever auctioned, Pablo Picasso's "Nude, green leaves and bust" which fetched $106.5 million -- just days after a landmark Picasso exhibition opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

"We have witnessed great strength at the top end of the market,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), particularly where superlative examples of modern sculpture are involved,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/")," said Marc Porter,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), chairman of Christie's Americas.

Among the 12 "Back IV" works produced, all but two are in museum collections including MOMA,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), London's Tate Modern and the Pompidou Center in Paris.

## Green Auction nets $2 million for environment

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Art collectors, environmentalists and celebrities packed the salesroom at Christie's on Thursday, the 40th Anniversary of Earth Day, and spent nearly $2 million at the Green Auction benefiting the environment.

A round of golf with former President Bill Clinton, a painting by Damien Hirst, a Girard-Perregaux white gold and diamond watch and 18 other lots drew spirited bidding from anonymous buyers as well as stars such as Salma Hayek and Chevy Chase, who served as emcee.

Edward Dolman,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-
outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), chief executive of Christie's International,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), called the event "a wonderfully appropriate way to celebrate Earth Day," adding that the response had been breathtaking.

"I like to think that we are one of the first to get seriously into recycling," he quipped in reference to the 244-year-old auction house's history of selling and reselling art and other fine collectibles.

Proceeds from the live auction,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), a companion silent online sale and related fund-raising events collectively known as "A Bid to Save the Earth" will be divided among the non-profit environmental groups Natural Resources Defense Council, the Central Park Conservancy, Oceana and Conservation International.

Other stars on hand included Sam Waterston and Ted Danson, along with newsmen Brian Williams and Matt Lauer, and Candice Bergen, who donated a tour of Central Park with the actress followed by lunch.

A few items, including a trip to Botswana for six guided by National Geographic's editor in chief, went as high as $150,000, while spirited bidding drove the price for golfing with Clinton to $80,000\. Bids totaled just over $1.5 million.

The silent auction (www.abidtosavetheearth.org) has drawn bids well in excess of $500,[Louis Vuitton Online](http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/ "http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/"),000 and could top $1 million or more by May 6, when it finishes.

Up for grabs are tennis lessons with John McEnroe, dinner and theater with actress Sigourney Weaver and a day on the set with Australian actor Hugh Jackman. A behind-the-scenes tour with Simon Doonen of Manhattan department store Barneys' legendary holiday window displays, along with lunch and a $5,000 gift card, has soared to $37,500.

With participation from quarters as far-reaching as Deutsche Bank,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), NBC Universal and retailers Target and Barneys, officials said the Green Auction reflected increasing understanding that business concerns are closely tied to environmental issues, and that the two need not be opposing forces.

Christie's waived all fees and commissions for the sale, and in a green nod did not print a catalog. And the event's "red carpet" was not red -- it was green.

"The Green Auction is a call to action," Dolman said before the auction.

Paddle raises,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), in which bidders made donations ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 to one of the environmental groups, took in another half million dollars, while cellphone users were encouraged to text GOGREEN to phone number 20222 to make a $10 donation.

## Sotheby's to sell modern collection in Amsterdam

LONDON (Reuters) - Sotheby's will offer more than 160 works of post-war and contemporary art from the Peter Stuyvesant Collection which it expects will raise 4-5 million euros ($5.5-$6.8 million).,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/ "http://www.guccioutleteonline.net/")

The collection was started by Alexander Orlow,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), who in 1960 invited 13 artists from 13 European countries to create paintings for the production hall at the Turmac Tobacco Company in the Netherlands as a way of brightening up the workplace.

He specified that the works should be large in scale and with vivid colors and shapes to fit in with his theme of "joie de vivre." He noted that productivity actually increased after their installation.

The March 8 sale in Amsterdam includes artists who fetched new auction records at a recent sale in London,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), and Sotheby's is hoping that demand is as strong next week.

Featuring in the auction will be Gunther Uecker and Jan Schoonhoven,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), two of the stars of Sotheby's contemporary art sale last month.

An Uecker work fetched $1.3 million, more than five times its pre-sale estimate, and another by Schoonhoven raised $1.2 million,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), about four times expectations.

The auction helped launch their names on the international art market, which has seen a strong revival after the downturn caused by the global financial crisis and recession.

The works on offer in Amsterdam are the property of British American Tobacco The Netherlands and form the largest collection of post-war and contemporary art ever to come to auction in the country.

They are the latest corporate art collection to go under the hammer at Sotheby's. The auctioneer recently set a world auction record when a Giacometti statue sold for $104.3 million in London after the work was offered to the market by Commerzbank.

## UOB chairman is Singapore's richest man-Forbes Asia

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The chairman of United Overseas Bank (UOBH.SI), Wee Cho Yaw,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), is the richest individual in Singapore with a fortune of $4.2 billion, an increase of $600 million compared with last year,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), according to the latest rich list published by Forbes Asia.

In March, Wee was ranked 268th on a Forbes list of the world's wealthiest individuals, although that may have changed due to volatile markets.

But Wee ranks third on the Singapore list, in which family fortunes were calculated,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), Forbes said. He comes after the families of the late Ng Teng Fong, a property tycoon, and the late Khoo Teck Puat, who sold a huge stake in Standard Chartered Bank (STAN.L) to state investor Temasek.

The Ng family remains at the top with $8.9 billion, higher by $1.1 billion than a year earlier. Their two biggest property holdings are privately held Far East Organisation and Hong Kong-listed Tsim Sha Tsui Properties (0247.HK).

Second on the list is the Khoo family with $6.7 billion, an increase of $800 million from a year ago. In 2006, they sold their stake in Standard Chartered Bank for around $4 billion,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), but they retain a stake in the Goodwood Group of Hotels.

After UOB's Wee comes New Zealander Richard Chandler with a fortune estimated at $4 billion from his emerging markets-focused investment group.

Singapore's 40 richest are now collectively worth $54.4 billion, up by 19 percent compared with last year,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), despite a slowing economy and weak stock market, Forbes said.

There are 13 billionaires on this year's list, compared with 11 last year. Sam Goi, a 62-year-old food tycoon who built his fortune from making spring roll skins, debuted at No. 12 with a net worth of $1.2 billion.

To compile the list,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), public fortunes were calculated using share prices and exchange rates as of July 12\. For privately held assets, Forbes Asia estimated their worth if they were made public.

This year, a minimum net worth of $210 million was needed to qualify for the list, up from $190 million previously.

The top 10 richest in Singapore are:

1) Ng Family; real estate; $8.9 billion

2) Khoo Family; banking; $6.7 billion

3) Wee Cho Yaw; banking; $4.2 billion

4) Richard Chandler; investments; $4 billion

5) Kwee Brothers; real estate; $3.9 billion

6) Kuok Khoon Hong; palm oil; $3.5 billion

7) Ong Beng Seng & Christina Ong; diversified; $1.9 billion

8) Peter Lim; investments; $1.8 billion

9) Kwek Leng Beng; diversified; $1.7 billion

10) Lee Seng Wee; banking; $1.4 billion

## Diet Etiquette for the Holidays

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Dining with others really is not about the food. It's about the people - and the relationships - around the table. That's true whether the table is bearing celery sticks or a 7-course dinner. Sharing sustenance is a gesture of companionship and generosity.

Holidays push this concept to the max, when rich, calorific avalanches seem to accompany good wishes everywhere you turn. Your co-worker is begging you to try her special cookies. Your buddy is pushing a seasonal splurge of Chocolate Thunder. Your hostess unfurls a buffet that has kept her in the kitchen for a month.

The good news: You can honour these gestures, enjoy the season,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), and hang on to your healthy ways. How? Like so many things, it starts with your attitude.

The Power of the Positive

So much holiday "dining advice" is negative: what we can't do, shouldn't eat, mustn't drink at all costs. The net result is that we spend our energy and attention on these Don't Wants and - of course - end up thinking of little else.

This year, try something else. Focus on what you want, not on what you want to avoid. You want to: Feel good about yourself - today and after January first. Be kind to your body and general health. Achieve your goals. Celebrate with friends and have fun.

And yet, if you take a woe-is-dieting-me attitude into the season, you will - believe me - fall short on every count. You will have no fun, be no fun and - worse - may even seem judgmental about your non-dieting friends and hosts.

Meanwhile, the self-pity won't help your weight goals one whit.

The Vision

Party smart. The basics:

Never go to a party hungry.

Eat an apple,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/"), a piece of cheese or some nuts and drink a full glass of water before you head out.

Watch your alcohol.

I stopped drinking alcohol at parties a long time ago, when I realized it clouded my thinking and sullied my healthy resolve. It's easy to substitute sparkling water or a soft drink. If you wish, you always can toast your success back home later.

Exercise or take a brisk walk around the block before the event. It will curb your appetite, ease your stress,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), and clear your head.

The Plan

You're on,[Gucci Outlet](http://www.guccioutletnonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletnonline.com/")!

It's a dinner at your boss' house. The menu is baked brie in puff pastry, beef Wellington and chocolate mousse. Heart attack on a plate. If you've done your homework and had your pre-party snack, hunger won't be gnawing at your good judgment.

Thus, you can nibble at your food, choosing the healthiest items in small portions, and sort of move the rest around on your plate to make it look like you've done the meal justice.

This is not the moment to announce that you don't eat dead animals - or, for various other reasons, anything else on your plate. It's not fair or kind to rain on anybody else's parade by bringing up your virtuous diet.

Instead, focus on being a charming, upbeat guest. That's what will get you a repeat invitation - not whether you've cleaned your plate! Thank your hostess sincerely for the delicious meal, whether or not you ate much. Mounting a dinner party requires time, effort, and expense. Honour that.

East Side, West Side

It's easier to navigate the shoals of dieting in restaurants where you have choices. But again, focus on the Wants rather than the Won'ts.

That might sound like, "I'd love the salmon grilled dry, a baked potato, and green salad with oil and vinegar, please." "I'd love a white wine spritzer." Or,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), I'd love those wonderful mixed berries with whipped cream on the side, please." And "Why don't you pass this basket of rolls down where the others can enjoy them?" is a whole lot more palatable than "No, no, a thousand times, no!"

Convey that you are embracing life's pleasures - not robbing yourself of them. Sometimes it's most gracious to avoid the word "no" altogether.

When declining something, try: "I think I'll pass on that tonight, thanks." By your statement, you have not passed any judgment on the indulgence or the indulgers. It's just that you choose not to partake tonight. (Your tablemates don't need to know that the very thought of it makes you queasy."

...All Around the Town

Once the season is in full swing, you won't be able to walk 20 feet without encountering a tray of cookies, a bowl of candy, or other tempting treats.

A simple, sincere "Oh, they look lovely, but I'll pass for now" should suffice. If someone absolutely insists you try Aunt Gert's fruitcake,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), graciously accept a small slice "for later" and discard it when you're gone.

Graceful Living

You don't have to choose between your healthy habits and good manners this season - or any time. Keep your spirit sparkling, your conversation warm and generous - and your opinions on yours and everyone else's diets to yourself. That should give you plenty to chew on!

## Italian museum defies pope over crucified frog

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian museum on Thursday defied Pope Benedict and refused to remove a modern art sculpture portraying a crucified green frog holding a beer mug and an egg that the Vatican had condemned as blasphemous.

The board of the Museion museum in the northern city of Bolzano decided by a majority vote that the frog was a work of art and would stay in place for the remainder of an exhibition.

The wooden sculpture by the late German artist Martin Kippenberger depicts a frog about 1 meter 30 cm (4 feet) high nailed to brown cross and holding a beer mug in one outstretched hand and an egg in another.

Called "Zuerst die Fuesse," (Feet First), it wears a green loin cloth and is nailed through the hands and the feet in the manner of Jesus Christ. Its green tongue hangs out of its mouth.

Kippenberger's works have been shown at the Tate Modern and the Saatchi Gallery in London and at the Venice Biennale, and retrospectives are planned in Los Angeles and New York.

Museum officials said the artist,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), who died in 1997,[Louis Vuitton Online](http://www.louisvuittononline-sale.com/ "http://www
.louisvuittononline-sale.com/"), considered it a self-portrait illustrating human angst.

Pope Benedict, who is German himself and was recently on holiday not far from Bolzano,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), did not agree.

The Vatican wrote a letter of support in the pope's name to Franz Pahl, president of the regional government who opposed the sculpture. Pahl released parts of the letter, which said the work "wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of God's love".

Pahl,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), whose province is heavily Catholic, was so outraged by the sculpture of the pop-eyed amphibian that he went on a hunger strike to demand its removal and had to be taken to hospital during the summer.

"Surely this is not a work of art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people,[Gucci Outlet Online](http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/ "http://www.guccioutletoonline.com/")," Pahl told Reuters by telephone.

"This decision to keep the statue there is totally unacceptable. It is a grave offence to our Catholic population," he said.

Museum president Alois Lageder told Reuters the decision to keep the statue on display was made in order to "safeguard the autonomy of art institutions".

The board vote was 6-3 in favor. Art experts defended the work.

"Art must always be free and the artist should not have any restrictions on freedom of expression," Claudio Strinati, a superintendent for Rome's state museums, told an Italian newspaper on Thursday.

But Italy's culture minister,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), Sandro Bondi, said museums that receive state funds should not "exalt artworks of desecration, of useless provocation and of nonsense".

## Strauss-Kahn case twist turns prospects upside-down

PARIS (Reuters) - News that the sex assault case against Dominique Strauss- Kahn could collapse hit France like a thunderbolt on Friday, raising prospects of a return to French politics, though probably not to the 2012 presidential race.

Socialists, who saw Strauss-Kahn as their best chance of winning power after years in opposition until his arrest in May, rejoiced at news that prosecutors in New York now doubt the credibility of the hotel maid who alleged he tried to rape her.

The dramatic twist revived anger among his French supporters over the way the former IMF chief was paraded handcuffed and unshaven by U.S. justice authorities,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"), and locked up in the notorious Rikers Island prison, before he had had a chance to defend himself.

But others in France said that even if his name were cleared, too much damage may have been done to Strauss-Kahn's reputation for him to be electable, although he could return gradually to politics and take a lesser post in government.

Two sources close to the case said the credibility of the hotel maid,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), a 32-year-old immigrant from the West African state of Guinea, was now in question. The New York Times said the prosecution case was on the verge of collapse.

"This is wonderful for Dominique (and) for his family. It's like the end of a nightmare. In any case, I have always been convinced he was not guilty," said Jean-Marie Le Guen, a Socialist deputy and close ally of Strauss-Kahn's.

"I think he will be a key player in politics in the months ahead,[Louis Vuitton Bags](http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), that people will expect him to contribute and that he will have a considerable weight."

Strauss-Kahn, under house arrest in New York, will go back to court on Friday, with prosecutors now discussing whether to drop the serious felony charges against him.

They may still seek to make him plead guilty to a lesser misdemeanour, with questions remaining over whether any sexual encounter was consensual or forced.

"Many things still count against him, including the calendar. It will take weeks or months to perfect his defence," Christophe Barbier, a political commentator and editor of L'Express weekly, told LCI television.

"Even if what he did was not criminal,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/"), all this is going to take time. There is everything we have learned about him, the damage to his reputation. All this makes the idea he could be a candidate very hypothetical, it's science fiction."

MUCK-RAKING DEBATE

Strauss-Kahn's arrest in May sent shockwaves through France, instantly dashing the former finance minister's chances of challenging President Nicolas Sarkozy in the April election.

The affair set off a muck-raking debate over his private life and the French media's practice of hushing up sexual misconduct by politicians.

It also sparked anger over the way U.S. law allowed the Frenchman to be paraded before TV cameras in a "perp walk", a practice unknown in France, meaning a backlash is now likely against a perceived rush to judgment in the U.S. media.

"When you are victim of a media campaign for three weeks and described in the way Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"), you don't emerge unscathed," said Francois Pupponi, Socialist mayor of the Paris suburb of Sarcelles, where Strauss-Kahn was once mayor.

Jean-Louis Borloo, a former energy minister expected to run as a centrist candidate in 2012 after falling out with Sarkozy last year, said it was conceivable Strauss-Kahn could now run.

"If things go as one would imagine and the charges are withdrawn ... what would prevent him coming back if he has the desire and energy to?" he told i>Tele television.

Candidates for the April 22 election can declare themselves up until a few weeks beforehand,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/"), but contenders for the Socialist primary must register by July 13, with left-wing voters due to pick the party's contestant in October.

Michele Sabban, a Socialist politician close to Strauss-Kahn, told i<Tele TV the party should suspend its primary contest to give Strauss-Kahn the time to enter.

"With the worldwide humiliation he's been through, I think it would be worth waiting," he said. "I hope as much effort will go into clearing his name as it did in destroying it." (Reporting by Marie Maitre, Jean-Baptiste Vey and Elizabeth Pineau; editing by Paul Taylor/Janet McBride)

## Bodies found from London's old Bedlam hospital

LONDON (Reuters) - Archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of skeletons at a 16th Century burial ground in the heart of the city that once served London's most notorious psychiatric hospital, the original "Bedlam".

The bones are expected to yield valuable information about mortality, diet and disease in the period.

They were discovered while experts surveyed a site that is destined to become a new ticket hall for the capital's huge Crossrail project at Liverpool Street Station.

Opened in 1247, the Bethlehem Royal Hospital began admitting the mentally ill in the 14th Century,[polo ralph lauren outlet](http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/ "http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/"), eventually becoming known by its middle-English abbreviation Bedlam.

The name became synonymous with disorder and confusion and struck fear into the heart of Londoners. The horror of its conditions, were immortalised in a painting by William Hogarth in 1735.

The picture is the last in a series of eight depicting "A Rake's Progress" -- a moral tale of a spendthrift young heir who squanders his money on drink, prostitutes and gambling.

He is eventually thrown into the old Fleet Prison close to the River Thames and ends up in Bedlam.

The burial ground was used from 1569 to the mid 19th century for Bedlam's patients and local residents when other cemeteries became overcrowded.

Jay Carver,[Rolex Luxury Watches](http://www.philipeswatches.net/ "http://www.philipeswatches.net/"), lead archaeologist for the huge Crossrail project which bisects the old city of London,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), said the well-preserved bodies were discovered after trial pits were dug.

"We've identified at least 100 individual burials within our small trial pit and, extrapolating that, it is very likely there will be several hundred if not a thousand plus..," he told Reuters.

The corpses, many found just 1.5 metres (5 ft) below street level, will be studied by experts at the museum of London, before being reburied.

"It's interesting on the archaeological side because the 16th century is a time of immense poverty really in the outer areas of the city of London. Sites of this type haven't always been fully investigated," Carver said.

The team also uncovered pottery fragments, clay pipes, animal bone artefacts,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/"), including knife handles, and, as yet, unidentified implements in association with the burials.

Towards the end of the 17th Century, the hospital moved to Moorfields in north London, now the site of Finsbury Circus.

Despite the new buildings with their well-kept gardens,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"), the treatment of the mentally ill did not greatly improve -- in the 18th Century, the public could visit Bedlam to stare at the patients for the price of one penny.

That practice died out long ago but the institution, now called the Bethlem Royal Hospital, still exists,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http
://store-coachoutlet.com/"), in Bromley, southeast of London.

## Shanghai eatery pairs food, wine, light, sound

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dinner at the Shanghai restaurant "Ultraviolet" starts at 7:30 p.m., after the guests have been driven to the windowless venue from another meeting spot by two vans.

Once they're seated, giant projections of red brick walls appear and start to shift upwards quickly, creating the illusion that the entire room is sinking. This is followed by the sound of cracking stone, a starry sky, lit purple candles,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http://store-
coachoutlet.com/"), and the ringing of a church bell.

Only then do waiters appear to serve the appetizer: a frozen wasabi-flavoured apple juice ball.

Housed in a former warehouse in central Shanghai, the restaurant, the brainchild of French-born Paul Pairet, serves a 22-course banquet that aims to stimulate all five senses to just ten guests a night.

"I want a single table that I can master. Once you control every element,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/"), from time,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), food to atmosphere, you make your own opera," said Pairet, who runs another high-ranked eatery in China's commercial hub. "Food is the lead."

Each course is served with a tailored set of visuals, sound and smell. Guests enjoy steamed lobsters as images of crashing waves are projected onto the walls, the refreshing smell of ocean sprayed from the diffusers and the sound of waves played through the speakers.

The restaurant, which opened in May, is a long-term dream for Pairet, who at the age of 18 decided to make a business out of one or the other of his hobbies, photography or cooking.

The former science student was fascinated by what he saw in his first cooking class in the southwestern city of Toulouse. A teacher showed them three glasses of water, each with sliced or whole carrots inside - and began to explain the phenomenon of diffusion and other biochemical reactions with cooking.

"That was very impressive, especially to people with scientific background," said Pairet, sipping an espresso. "To cook, I need to understand what I am doing."

After graduating, Pairet first drew attention at Cafe Mosaic in Paris. Over ten years, he travelled to Hong Kong,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"), Sydney, and Istanbul, finally settling in Shanghai in 2005 to open "Jade on 36," a restaurant in the Shangri-La hotel.

There, guests order from four sets of menus, each of three different sizes, depending on how hungry they are.

Pairet soon found guests had difficulty making orders and particularly in pairing dishes with wine. He felt it would be good to use a table d'hôte, the serving tradition where the host decides the menu and guests all eat the same thing.

"Forget about choosing (the food),[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/")," he said. "We pair food together with drinks, either wine or non-alcoholic beverages. To maintain a balance of all 22 dishes... all the drinks need to be balanced too."

PS
YCHO TASTE

In late 2009, he spent 6 months looking for a place to launch his dream restaurant, then laid out $2.5 million to renovate the space.

He paired each course with a beverage - mostly wine,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), sometimes sherry, beer and Chinese tea - and a scenario which he boasted could stimulate the customer's "psycho-taste".

"Then we work on the settings. It can be as simple as the light or a combination of image projections and scents," he said.

The current meal follows the lobster with truffle-topped bread accompanied by scenery of a forest and a scent called "Autumn Soil". The main course of sea bass is served with the images of colourful tropical fish swimming around the room.

The experience does not come cheaply at 2,000 yuan a guest, but most seatings are booked through the end of September - something Pairet attributes partly to Shanghai's willingness to accept new ideas.

Does the multi-sensory experience really add to the food?

"Do you want to read the book of comments (from guests)?" Pairet said. "If I tell you everything they have told me, I would appear pretentious." (Reporting By Shanghai Newsroom, editing by Elaine Lies)

# Egypt's unrest blights 2011 tourism revenue

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's vital tourism industry,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), crippled by political turmoil, will suffer a 25 percent drop in revenue in 2011 and will need until September to get back on track, the tourism minister said in an interview on Thursday.

An 18-day popular uprising that forced out President Hosni Mubarak saw much of Egypt's economy grind to a halt and slashed tourism revenue for February by more than half.

March figures fell by 60 percent from last year, Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour said.

With its pharaonic antiquities and year-round warm beaches, Egypt relies on tourism as its top foreign currency earner, source of over a tenth of gross domestic product. It provides one in eight jobs in a country beset by high unemployment.

"Our revenues of 2010 were $12.5 billion, we should be 25 percent below that in 2011," Abdel Nour told Reuters, but said it could be pushed even lower.

"Egypt is in transition,[louis vuitton outlet online](http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/"), at the end of the day, and any transition path could be bumpy," he said.

The turmoil that scared tourists away and prompted overseas warnings against visiting Egypt has abated. Tourists are dribbling back and most of the warnings have been lifted.

But hotel occupancy rates in the key Red Sea resorts of Hurghada and Sharm el- Sheikh, remain below 40 percent, Abdel Nour said.

"Until today, we have not recouped the normal pace of tourism in Egypt. That was expected and it is understandable. But we expect to be back on track by September."

Egypt is launching a global advertising campaign, pressing for the lifting of remaining travel bans and offering incentives to cut charter flight fees, the minister said.

STABILITY

The tourism ministry is working with young Egyptians who have launched an "Egypt is Safe" campaign, and is counting on bringing visitors to Cairo's Tahrir Square, the epicentre of protests, as an attraction.

"Tahrir square has become a target for tourists to visit,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"), it has become a popular destination," Abdel Nour said, adding that social media were also being used to bring back tourists.

Google Inc (GOOG.O), whose executive Wael Ghonim played a key role in Egypt's uprising, wanted to coordinate a marketing campaign with Egyptian tourism authorities and would help with selling airline tickets online, he said.

Egypt has coped with a number of tourism scares in recent years. In 1997, gunmen killed 58 tourists and four Egyptians at an ancient temple near the southern town of Luxor,[polo ralph lauren outlet](http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/ "http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/"), severely damaging tourism.

From 2004 to 2006, there were a series of deadly bomb attacks at Red Sea resorts in the Sinai, but tourist bookings swiftly recovered.

Recovering from the political turmoil this time will be much more challenging and take more time, Abdel Nour said.

"The name of the game is peace and stability and until the tourist is convinced that security is restored to the country, we will not be able to recoup what we have lost,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http
://store-coachoutlet.com/")," he said.

"We are doing whatever we can to inform the world that security is prevailing, that hotels and Egyptians are waiting to receive tourists,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-
usonline.net/")," Abdel Nour said. "And with this effort, I expect the last quarter of the year to be excellent." (Editing by Barry Moody, Ron Askew)

# Egypt uprising art brightens Cairo, tempts buyers

CAIRO (Reuters) - A flowering of Egyptian art since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak is adding colour to the capital Cairo and an upswing in business at the city's galleries, as the pride, anger and optimism of a long-frustrated generation plays out on canvas.

Politically-inspired photography, graphic design and graffiti sprayed or stencilled on walls, fences, bridges and fly-overs have flourished since the 18-day uprising toppled the autocratic leader.

Across Cairo, faces of protesters killed during the uprising are immortalized on concrete, fists are shown breaking free from ropes and ancient mummies scream "I am free!".

Much of the street art reflects pride in the movement that united Egyptians across class and religion to put an end to decades of calcified politics and a gaping rich-poor divide.

In Nasr City, a beautiful woman is spray-painted on a fence surrounding a plot of disused land, her dress in the flowing colours of Egypt's red, white and black national flag. Further west in Mohandiseen, an imam and a priest are shown standing hand in hand on the side of one building.

Elsewhere it is darker, angrier. One image painted on a disused building shows a man writhing in chains wrapped tight around his body.

Other graffiti shows anger towards Mubarak and his family -- the former leader is depicted scowling arrogantly or with his head in a noose -- or anxiety at whether Egypt's military rulers really want to deliver the country to democratic civilian rule.

An army officer sketched on a wall in a busy street asks passers-by "man antum?" (who are you?), an allusion to Muammar Gaddafi's disdainful question aimed at Libyan rebels, implying that the military council holds Egyptians in similar contempt.

"ENORMOUS INTEREST"

Some art dealers say the movement is grabbing the attention of collectors at home and abroad.

"There's an enormous interest and push for the graffiti artists, for the illustrators, for the new comic books that are coming out," said William Wells, Director of Cairo's Townhouse Gallery. "At the moment, foreigners are coming through the city constantly looking for them."

Mona Said, owner of Safar Khan gallery, said she received strong interest in her first "To Egypt with Love" exhibition at the gallery in March. The exhibition displayed photography and graphic artwork inspired by the uprising.

"I sold four times what I expected to sell,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/")," said Said. "I shipped all over the world."

Hossam Hassan,[polo ralph lauren outlet](http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/ "http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/"), who combines photography, digital design and painting, depicted protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square at Safar Khan's gallery.

He said the beige background of his canvases reflects a decaying feeling on the eve of the uprising.

"Everything was cloudy, beige, colourless, tasteless before the revolution. These people came with their energy and injected this red, orange, yellow energy into Egypt," he said, pointing to the splashes of colour on the paintings.

Hassan says his work on the uprising will be exhibited in European capitals including Vienna and London this year and will appear next year in a Paris exhibition commemorating the first day of the uprising,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-
usonline.net/"), January 25.

FEARS OF CENSORSHIP

Other artists hope their depictions of the revolution will promote social causes they say were neglected under Mubarak, who is on trial accused of authorising the use of live ammunition to shoot protesters, of corruption and abuse of power.

Hanan el-Nahrawy, a deaf-mute artist who has produced surrealistic oil and ink images of Mubarak, said -- through her son who interprets for her -- that she wants to spread awareness for deaf-mutes who received little care under the former leader.

"Mubarak did not like the disabled, whatever their disability," said Nahrawy. "In the days of (previous president) Anwar al-Sadat, there was more attention to the disabled."

One of Nahrawy's canvases depicts the Nile flowing through Mubarak's face, its delta branching off in vein-like lines on his forehead. A small fist carrying tear-shaped nooses is painted on one of his cheeks,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), while small images of people carrying Egypt's flag chip away at the other.

"These are the protesters trying to find out what's hidden, how much he owns,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/")," said Nahrawy. "The veins are like the reverberations of an earthquake. The revolution shook Mubarak."

Another of Nahrawy's works shows the Nile passing through an image that combines Mubarak's face with that of Hussein Salem,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), a close confidant of the former president charged with squandering public funds. Dollar signs fill the background.

Inspiration from the country's political upheaval is mixed with fears of political censorship by Egypt's army, which has ruled since Mubarak's overthrow on February 11\. Rights groups worry over the army's use of military trials in cases where civilians criticised its actions.

Many artists are concerned that religious conservatives now vying for power may try to exert pressure that will curb freedom of expression.

"We've moved into a situation that's a little bit disturbing with the army now adopting similar tactics in terms of censorship that we had prior to February 11," said Wells.

Hassan said the diversity of religion and culture that has inspired artists in Egypt is under threat from strict Islamist groups such as the Salafists.

"This is not right for Egypt. We'll go back to where we were before the revolution and worse," said Hassan.

"The beauty of Egypt is its diversity. I get very upset when Islamists or Salafists say 'Egypt is Islamist, it has to be this' ... the depth and strength of Egypt is that it's Coptic (Christian), Pharoanic, Muslim, modern and old."

# Four US airports to test expedited screening plan

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities will begin allowing some frequent fliers this fall to participate in a pilot program for expedited screening at four hub airports,[louis vuitton outlet online](http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/"), the Transportation Security Administration said on Thursday.

Frequent fliers with Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and AMR Corp's American Airlines AMR.N as well as anyone enrolled in the Customs and Border Protection agency's Trusted Traveler programs could qualify to go through expedited screening in Atlanta,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http://store-
coachoutlet.com/"), Detroit, Miami and Dallas-Fort Worth.

The TSA has been under pressure to tailor airport security screening to focus on higher risks, particularly after complaints that young children and the elderly are being unnecessarily scrutinized.

The complaints also follow the introduction of physical patdowns for passengers who refuse to go through new full-body scanners or set off such detectors.

"Enhancing identity-based screening is another common sense step in the right direction as we continue to strengthen overall security and improve the passenger experience whenever possible," TSA Administrator John Pistole said in a statement.

Officials said the program would start sometime in the fall but did not say how long it would run.

Authorities and airlines would review a traveller's information before they would be eligible for the pilot program. Of the 1.8 million who go through checkpoints daily,[Louis Vuitton Bags](http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), some 5,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-
usonline.net/"),000 to 8,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"),000 U.S. citizens a day could get such screening.

Pistole has said previously that expedited screening could permit a traveler to keep his or her shoes on and also not be required to take a laptop out of the bag for X-ray.

Passengers who are part of the pilot still may be subjected to regular screening procedures in a bid to ensure randomness,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), according to TSA. The agency said also it hoped to expand the program to other U.S. air carriers and airports later (Reporting and writing by Jeremy Pelofsky; Editing by Bill Trott)

# Art market buzzes ahead of Basel, London sales

LONDON (Reuters) - Billions of dollars of art will be on show in Basel at the annual fair this week and in London ahead of a big series of sales, with experts cautiously optimistic that buyers are set to snap up rare treasures.

Art Basel, described as the world's top fair for modern and contemporary works, opens on Wednesday with 300 galleries displaying works with a combined total worth of around $1.75 billion,[Louis Vuitton Bags](http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), according to specialist insurer Hiscox.

"We didn't do a calculation last year, but my guess is that this year is up about 15 percent (on 2010)," said Hiscox fine art specialist Robert Read.

He added that the mood in the market was generally confident, with the sharp contraction in global sales in 2009 already a fading memory.

"I think we're further away from the bad news," he told Reuters. "People forget things so quickly. Buying art is fun and sexy, and people were never going to give it up forever,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.net/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.net/"), were they?"

Once the wheeling and dealing in Basel is done by its close on June 19, the focus shifts to London where rivals Christie's and Sotheby's hold sales where the strength or otherwise of the market will be more visible.

Christie's described its upcoming season as "one of the company's richest and most exciting,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/")," and expects to raise more than 250 million pounds ($410 million) over four weeks.

The company has opened an exhibition in London this week of more than 100 works to be offered to super-rich collectors and investors, including a drawing by Michelangelo and paintings by George Stubbs, Claude Monet and Pablo Picasso.

Also on display will be a sculpture by Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries discovered during a routine Christie's valuation at a European castle and expected to fetch 5-8 million pounds.

Christie's starts its main sales of the season on June 21 with an impressionist and modern art evening sale.

CHINESE BUBBLE?

Sotheby's expects its equivalent series to raise in excess of around 215 million pounds, including what it said could be a record auction price for Austrian artist Egon Schiele, whose cityscape goes under the hammer on June 22.

The painting is being sold by the Leopold Museum and is estimated to be worth up to 30 million pounds ($50 million) which would comfortably surpass the current Schiele record of $22.4 million.

A Venetian view by Francesco Guardi has been valued at around 20 million pounds and is the highlight of the Old Masters sale on July 6.

Experts said the art market has yet to regain the giddy heights of the boom that preceded the 2009 slump,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"), although Chinese art has soared in value as wealthy new buyers compete for the top lots.

Recent examples include the $65 million paid last month for a work by Qi Baishi and the $69 million price tag on a Chinese vase dated from the 1740s,[polo ralph lauren outlet](http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/ "http://www.poloralphlaurenoutlett.com/"), 40 times its estimate, at a sale in London in November.

Chinese collectors have also branched out into Western art and could be a major factor in the market over the coming month, although some analysts have warned of the risk of an unsustainable art rush developing.

Vikram Mansharamani, a lecturer at Yale University, recently drew comparisons between China's influence on the art market and that of Japan in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when buyers there smashed auction records only for the boom to turn to bust.

"It reflects a national overconfidence that has been a consistent ingredient in financial bubbles,[louis vuitton outlet online](http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/")," he wrote.

"Prudent investors would take great pride in selling at world record prices. Wanting to buy at world record prices is a spectacular reflection of hubris in action."

# U.S. bidder snags William and Kate Pez for $13,000

VIENNA (Reuters) - A fan from Connecticut has paid 8,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/"),200 pounds ($13,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"),360) to win a charity auction of PEZ sweets dispensers in the likeness of Britain's Prince William and his fiancee Kate Middleton ahead of this month's royal wedding.

PEZ,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), the Austrian company whose candy dispensers are known around the world, said on Monday it will donate the money to the Starlight Children's Foundation, which cheers up seriously ill children and their families by granting wishes and organizing hospital events.

A spokeswoman said the company chose that charity because Middleton and her family supported it.

She gave no more details about the winning bidder other than to say his or her user profile was Frank841950.

The winning bid,[louis vuitton outlet online](http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/"), one of 33 submitted,[Louis Vuitton Bags](http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), falls short of the record $32,000 paid for an Astronaut B model Pez dispenser in 2006.

# Air travellers want more self-service, study finds

GENEVA (Reuters) - International airline passengers want self-service extended from online booking and kiosk check-in to security and passport control and boarding their flights, an industry report said on Wednesday.

The report,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/"), based on surveys taken at seven major airports on five continents, said most travellers also want more automation for handing in baggage and paying excess fees,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"), reporting missing luggage and switching flights.

The surveys found that on-line booking and check-in have well overtaken the traditional methods of visiting an airline office or travel agent and collecting boarding passes from registration desks at the airport.

"People just want more self-service at every step of their journey," said Quentin Browell, spokesman for the airline industry's leading information technology supplier SITA which issues the report annually.

The report said an average of 71 percent of passengers surveyed at the seven hubs had booked in online or at automated airport kiosks for their flights, and many more would be ready to do so if they understood the process better.

But checking in on mobile phones was much less common, with only 3 percent of those questioned on the day of the survey having used the method.

The Geneva-based SITA recorded a sharp growth in passengers using airline websites to book hotels -- up from 21 percent of those surveyed in 2009 to 38 percent this year -- and to rent cars -- up from 19 to 35 percent.

There were similar increases in use of carriers' websites for other services like buying travel insurance,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http
://store-coachoutlet.com/"), bus and train tickets and for ordering duty-free items in advance,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/"), SITA said.

The surveys were carried out on a single day among what SITA said was a representative sample of the millions of travellers using the seven airports -- Atlanta, Beijing,[Rolex Luxury Watches](http://www.philipeswatches.net/ "http://www.philipeswatches.net/"), Frankfurt, Johannesburg-Tambo, Mumbai, Moscow Domodedovo and Sao Paulo.

The report did not identify exactly how passengers saw automation working in security and passport control,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"), or in baggage check-in, but methods of easing these processes are understood to be under study at SITA.

The survey also found that travellers in North America and Asia were increasingly willing to pay a small extra fee to offset the carbon footprint of their flight.

Some 44 percent of those questioned at Mumbai already did so, 35 percent at Beijing and 27 percent at Atlanta said they already did so, according to SITA. But at Frankfurt, one of Europe's largest hubs, the figure was only 6 percent.

# Exhibitions Ancient Egypt's Book of the Dead in London show

LONDON (Reuters) - The delicate details of the afterlife written down on papyrus by the ancient Egyptians have been unfurled in public at a British Museum show in London.

"Journey Through the Afterlife: Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead" explores in more detail than ever before the complex theology laid out in the Book of the Dead, an illustrated guide to death and negotiating the perils of the underworld.

The British Museum has gathered together an unrivalled collection of these papyri, many of which have never been on show, not least because they are so delicate.

The exhibition winds through the museum's circular Reading Room in chronological order, from the moment of death to burial,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), judgement, and finally paradise.

"The main aim really is to give people a deeper understanding of ancient Egyptian beliefs about life after death and to throw more light on their hopes and fears," exhibition curator John Taylor told Reuters.

Mummification -- long the focus of popular Egyptology -- was only the first step on the path to eternal life.

"This exhibition is really meant to be the next stage: what happens after that; after you've been mummified and put in your tomb? What happens to your spirit? We're trying to tell that story," Taylor said.

BEYOND THE GRAVE

Once buried, the dead's spirit left the tomb to begin its journey through an underworld fraught with danger.

The Book of the Dead contained spells to help the spirit through this spiritual obstacle course by enabling it to eat, breathe and ward off cockroaches, amongst other things.

Without the right spells for protection, the dead might be attacked by snakes and crocodiles, or worse yet, die again.

The final hurdle was the weighing of the heart, when the deceased's heart was placed on a scale with the Feather of Truth as counter-weight.

If clean from sin,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/"), the heart would balance the feather, guaranteeing entry to paradise: the Field of Reeds. If not, the deceased was tossed to a hideous creature called The Devourer.

These trials are documented in the world's longest Book of the Dead -- the Greenfield Papyrus -- all 37 metres of which are on display at the British Museum for the very first time.

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN HUMOUR

With their solemn masks and sharp profiles,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), the ancient Egyptians are not known for levity and wit, but a satirical papyrus in the exhibition offers a rare insight into ancient Egyptian humour with a menagerie of animals pictured seated on chairs around a table, playing 'senet', an Egyptian board game.

"They seemed to like the idea of mocking human behaviour by showing animals in the role of humans," said Taylor,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), noting a similarity with today's caricatures.

As well as papyri, the exhibition also includes coffins, amulets,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), tomb figurines,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), gilded masks and mummy effects, with loans from museums in Paris, Boston and Leiden.

The exhibition is the first of three British Museum shows to examine death and spirituality through the ages. An exhibition next year on devotion in Medieval Europe will be followed in 2012 by one about the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the haj.

"Journey Through the Afterlife: Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead" is on at the British Museum until March 6.

"As viewed currently,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), the target of a further increase on the previous year's figure no longer appears to be achievable," the company said in a brief statement on Tuesday.

Lufthansa generated an operating profit of 876 million euros last year.

Analysts on average had been expecting profit of 1.042 billion euros for 2011,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), according to Thomson Reuters Starmine, which gives greater weight to top-rated analysts. Estimates had ranged from 856 million euros to 1.07 billion.

Lufthansa's shares were down 6 percent at 10.12 euros at 1036 GMT,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), making them the biggest decliner on Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI.

"In past remarks, the company has prepared the market for such a move. Still, a profit warning never is a good thing," a trader said.

The passenger airlines unit includes Lufthansa,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), Austrian Airlines,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), bmi, Germanwings and Swiss airlines.

Bmi has been hurt particularly hard by the loss of business in the Middle East and North Africa following uprisings in the region this year and reported a 9 percent drop in sales for August.

Lufthansa said it had therefore adjusted its booking trend expectations and would further reduce scheduled capacities on its winter timetable.

The company said in July it was scaling back its plans to increase capacity this winter after soaring fuel costs led to lower than expected profits in the first six months of the year.

Industry body IATA earlier on Tuesday forecast a 29 percent fall in 2012 industry-wide profit on the back of a weak global economy and stubbornly high jet fuel prices.

# Top 10 fishing destinations

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Immerse yourself in Scotland by reeling in salmon, or bundle up in Newfoundland for an outing to catch yellowtail and mackerel.

Whether your preference is cod or bluefin, Cape Town or Cabo, online travel advisers Cheapflights.com (www.cheapflights.com) offers its top 10 fishing destinations.

Reuters has not endorsed this list:

1\. Sutherland, Scotland

From a boat or from the shore, fishing is a brilliant way to enjoy Scotland. Even though the outdoor sport isn't allowed on Sundays at the Kyle of Sutherland, there are six other days of the week to take advantage of the bounty that this majestic landscape has to offer.

The area is famous for its supply of salmon, and brown and sea trout. Handy for novices,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), the Kyle of Sutherland Angling Association has produced a booklet to help fishermen figure out where to go to reel in the best fish around. A permit for a day of sea trout fishing costs visitors only 8\. The view of Scotland's rolling hills, though, is priceless.

2\. Phuket, Thailand

Deep sea fishing is a must if you find yourself on Thailand's southern beach haven, Phuket. The clear, blue waters of the Andaman Sea set the scene for some of the best fishing in the world.

Cast your line and wait for tuna, swordfish, blue and black marlin, and other impressive sea creatures to bite. A strict catch-and-release policy means you won't be dining on your accomplishments, but a photo for Facebook on Thailand's west coast may do instead.

3\. Florida Keys, United States

Set your iPod to Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville," pour yourself an appropriately-mixed beverage, and spend a day relaxing on South Florida's turquoise seas.

There you'll find the Marquesas Keys, located off of Key West's west coast - an ideal spot for fishing. The marine sanctuary law ensures an abundance of wildlife, where you'll catch shark and barracuda. There's a very remote feel because a lot of charters aren't willing to make the trip because of high fuel prices.

Find a charter that's willing to go the extra mile, literally, for quite possibly the most unforgettable fishing trip of your life.

4\. Cape Town, South Africa

Visitors flock to Africa's southernmost city for culture that's brimming with excitement. Fishermen flock for its coastline, brimming with tuna.

The area has some of the richest tuna grounds in the world and also some of the globe's toughest fighting fish. A diverse ecosystem guarantees you'll see albatross,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), killer whales and dolphins galore. Tuna season lasts from September to June,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), but there are opportunities to throw your net year round.

5\. Sicily, Italy

Fishing is synonymous with Sicily and,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), unfortunately, its fish population has started dwindling as a result. But you can't go to the Italian isle and not try spearfishing. You physically dive into the water and spear the fish - with a spear.

Patience is of the essence, as the underwater creatures are both quick and cunning, so stick to shallow waters.

6\. Cabo San Lucas, Mexico

Appropriately nicknamed the "Marlin Capital of the World," Cabo San Lucas in Mexico is a place to bring your highest-quality camera. There's nothing like capturing your family's Christmas card on the beaches of Mexico's most abundant shoreline - with a massive marlin on display.

More than 3,000 species of marine life live off the Baja Peninsula - and marlin rule the seas. Some of the most well regarded yacht charters around, like the Picante Bluewater Sportfishing fleet, take eager novices out daily, year round.

7\. Montauk Point, New York, United States

Montauk Point, a glacial cliff on the east coast of Long Island, provides a fishing retreat for New Yorkers, Philadelphians, Bostonians - and everyone in between. Thankfully charter groups that take you out come equipped with experienced captains who know what they're doing.

Bring the family to reel in tuna, striped bass and shark that swim the eastern shore of the United States. Remember to bring a cooler: your finest catches can serve as dinner after a sun-filled day on the high seas.

8\. Newfoundland, Canada

The tastiest fish in the world, from Arctic char to rainbow trout to cod, live off the coast of Newfoundland on Canada's east coast. Stay inland along Newfoundland's Flowers River if salmon piques your interest. But for saltwater species, like yellowtail and mackerel, head east to the blistery coast.

The area, between its mountainous terrain and serene surroundings, is an ideal spot to bait your hook, sit back and relax. Until you get your first bite, of course.

9\. Puget Sound,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), Washington, United States

For a day trip from Seattle, try nearby Puget Sound. The waters are calm and it's easy to relax - perfect for the stressed out workaholic who just wants to get away from it all.

Turn off your cell phone, cast your line,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), and sit back while the salmon comes to you. Your view of Mount Rainer and the Olympic Mountains will be worth the trip. Fishing is popular in the area, so there's no shortage of charters to take you out. Sign up ahead of time, and then go with the flow.

10\. Victoria, Australia

Imagine your boat rocking back and forth as roaring waves push it farther and farther away from shore. You've got your fishing lines in tow and you're ready to catch something big.

Powerful and wild waves are no strangers to Bass Strait. The strait, which separates Tasmania from Victoria, has a reputation for being rough. But you need to get out there if you hope to see sharks -- great hammerheads, gummy, school and spurred dog sharks -- off of Australia's coast.

# Accor says targeted buys may boost Indian expansion

PARIS (Reuters) - Acquisitions might be a way for hotels group Accor to accelerate its expansion in India,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), where it wants to open 90 hotels by the end of 2015 and overtake market leader Carlson, the French firm said on Thursday.

Chief Executive Denis Hennequin told Accor's annual shareholders' meeting he was confident about 2012 prospects despite an uncertain economic climate in Europe after achieving strong growth in Asia and Latin America in the first quarter.

Accor (ACCP.PA) has 15 hotels in India, where it has been expanding mostly through joint ventures with local partners.

"Ninety hotels in India is an ambitious but realistic goal and we may look into making targeted acquisitions to accelerate our development," Hennequin said.

Last month,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), Accor, the world's fourth-largest hotel group behind InterContinental (IHG.L),[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), Marriott (MAR.N) and Starwood (HOT.N),[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), said that it expected a recovery in hotel demand to continue in the second quarter as it posted 4.5 percent like-for-like growth in first-quarter revenue.

Some analysts worry that Accor,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org"), which makes 70 percent of its operating profit in Europe, is more exposed than peers to a region where the business climate might be tougher this year.

"We have growth prospects not just in Europe but worldwide,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/")," Hennequin said on Thursday. "Asia and Latin America continued to grow double-digit at the start of the year. There is a recovery in the U.S ... We can expect 2012 to be in line with our commitments."

With operations in 90 countries ranging from the luxury Sofitel chain to the budget Ibis and Motel 6 operations, Accor has a market capitalisation of 5.7 billion euros.

# InterContinental to return $1 bln from hotel sales

LONDON (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels, the world's biggest hotelier, cheered investors by promising to return $1 billion to them funded from the planned sale of a New York hotel and added its flagship London Park Lane hotel is set to be next on the block.

The British-based group, home to the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn as well as InterContinental brands, said it will pay a special dividend in the fourth quarter costing $500 million, and also kick off a $500 million share buyback in the same three months.

Chief Executive Richard Solomons said the return of capital reflected the planned sale of its New York Barclay hotel, which analysts expect to fetch around $300 million, as the group reported a 6 percent rise in half-year profits boosted by good trading in its two biggest markets, the United States and China.

The hotelier's strategy to sell hotel assets in return for management contracts is similar to U.S. peers like Marriott (MAR.N), and has helped return $8.9 billion, including $1.2 of ordinary dividends,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), since the group's formation in 2003.

The capital return helped boost its shares up 6.5 percent to 1,727 pence by 0933 GMT to be the biggest riser in the FTSE 100 index .FTSE in a largely flat London stock market.

The group (IHG.L) only owns 10 of its 4,500-plus hotels worldwide with a book value of $1.6 billion, with most of that value being in its flagship hotels in New York,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org"), London, Paris and Hong Kong which are all expected to be eventually sold.

The year-long sale process of the New York Barclay should be closed in the next few months, Solomons said, and talks are under way with one exclusive buyer,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), which analysts say is likely to be the Qatari hotel owner Ghanim Bin Saad Al Saad.

Solomons said that once the group opens its second InterContinental in London in the first quarter of 2013 then it is likely to sell its Park Lane hotel in return for a management contract. Analysts estimate its value at over $330 million.

He added this was consistent with the group's "asset light" strategy and returning funds to shareholders while still maintaining the group's BBB investment grade credit rating.

"Interest will come from high net worth and sovereign wealth money from the Middle East, Russia and possibly south-east Asia," said Robert Seabrook, head of hotel transactions at property consultant Savills (SVS.L).

"It's one down from the likes of the Dorchester but is at the bottom of arguably the best hotel street in London," he said.

CONTINUED GROWTH

Solomons said the group reported growth in the half year across all regions, and both hotel occupancy and room rates increased and, despite a tough economic environment, the group was trading well and continued to see growth for the future.

"There might be a little bit of a slowdown in July but that is for one-off factors and for the medium time, the outlook is good," said Solomons. He added one-off factors included the U.S. July 4 independence day falling in mid-week, and by the end of July growth rates were back running similar to the half year.

Growth in half year global revenue per available room (RevPAR),[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), a key industry measure, grew 6.5 percent with the United States and China ahead 7.2 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. In July, global growth slowed by 3.8 percent.

The Olympic Games had seen the group's 51 London hotels full,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), but the effect was "financially neutral" as games guests replaced regular London visitors, Solomons said.

The hotelier, which operates more than 660,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"),000 rooms in over 4,500 hotels worldwide, posted a 6 percent rise in half- year operating profit to $286 million, in line with an average forecast of $285 million in a company-compiled consensus.

Revenue increased 3 percent to $878 million.

The half-year dividend rose 31 percent to 21 U.S. cents following a decision to rebalance its interim towards one third of the total for the year.

Results from rival hoteliers such as Marriott and Starwood (HOT.N) have shown signs of a steady industry recovery despite some weakness in euro zone crisis hit southern European nations and some slower growth in China .

Solomons added he was confident the group had complied with all competition laws after Britain's consumer watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading, accused the hotelier of price fixing with two major online travel agents to restrict discounts that could be offered for hotel rooms .

# Carlson, Rezidor to operate hotels under one name

n">(Reuters) - U.S. hotel,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), restaurant and travel group Carlson and Rezidor Hotel Group (REZT.ST) of Brussels are joining their hotel operations under one name in a bid to boost revenue and compete better globally.

The Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group will develop the Radisson, Country Inns & Suites, and other hotel brands, manage commercial activities and have a global sales force. The group includes more than 1,300 hotels across 80 countries.

"We're building a global platform across the two companies for the hotel business," Hubert Joly, Carlson president and chief executive,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), said in an interview on Wednesday.

"The name change eliminates any ambiguity for the business partners,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), makes it very clear that they are dealing with one group," Joly said.

The companies are looking to raise more than $400 million in additional hotel revenue by 2015 and bolster revenue per available room through projects such as partnerships with travel agencies and expansion of the Club Carlson loyalty program.

Joly said a key priority of the partnership would be to expand the upscale Radisson Blu hotel brand. The group's rivals include InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG.L),[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), Starwood Hotels and Resorts (HOT.N) and Hilton.

Minneapolis-based Carlson, which also operates TGI Friday's restaurants and the Carlson Wagonlit Travel agency, is majority shareholder of Rezidor. The relationship between the two companies dates back to 1994,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), with the signing of a master franchise agreement for the Radisson brand in Europe,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org"), Middle East and Africa. Subsequent agreements have expanded Rezidor's franchise rights.

"We probably have not exploited the synergies we could have exploited over the years," said Kurt Ritter, president and CEO of Rezidor.

A new website, www.carlsonrezidor.com, will debut February 1.

# German firm starts selling space travel insurance

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A German firm is to start offering space travel insurance,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org"), hoping to cash in on a new wave of 'ordinary astronauts' ahead of next year's first commercial space trips.

Insurance giant Allianz will start offering its new space travel policies from the start of next year to coincide with the launch of Virgin Galactic,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), the spaceflight company owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group.

So far about 450 people have reserved seats for the $200,000, five-minute trips into 'sub-orbital' space, the point where weightlessness kicks in and the curvature of the earth and blackness of space can be seen.

Erick Morazin, the Allianz account director in charge of the plans, told Reuters that the while the prices were still being finalised, the most basic level of insurance for such trips was likely to start at around $700 and go up to as much as $10,000.

"We are looking into space tourism as a new market for the next generation of travellers,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/")," he said.

"Typically the price of an insurance policy is around 3-4 percent of the total trip cost. So if we were covering the cancellation of a trip,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), the loss incurred by the customer would be $20,000 -- the price of the deposit -- so the cost of the policy would be around $700."

Morazin added that Allianz had sketched out around 20 different insurance packages that add medical, luggage and other forms of cover to the basic policy. He was wary about giving too many details,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), however, fearing that it could benefit rival insurance firms also looking to enter the space travel market.

Virgin is not the first firm to offer paying customers trips into space.

One firm, Space Adventures,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), has so far sent seven people into space and is currently offering customers the chance to do space walks and orbit the moon. Boeing Co (BA.N) has also said it plans to develop passenger spaceships. (for story click )

U.S. plans to scale back NASA's missions is partly driving commercial firms' current interest in providing space trips.

Following the retirement of the U.S. shuttle fleet, Washington has announced plans to fund an $850 million investment in commercial passenger spaceships and in future is expected to pay firms to take its astronauts into space.

# Thai Airways says unsure of making 2011 net profit

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Airways International Pcl THAI.BK said on Friday it was unsure whether global economic uncertainty would prevent it from making a net profit for 2011, but it would go ahead with plans to launch a new regional carrier and another budget airline.

"The economic concerns in the United States and Europe may slow down air travel demand, while the impact from fuel costs may not be as bad as earlier expected," President Piyasvasti Amranand told reporters after a board meeting.

"But we can't say right now that we will make profit for the whole year,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/")," he said,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), citing the volatility of global oil prices.

Fuel costs account for about 40 percent of the airline's total costs.

The national carrier is expected to report a net profit of 6.7 billion baht for 2011,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

It reported a first-half net loss of 7.26 billion baht, versus a net profit of 11.9 billion baht a year earlier.

The flag carrier planned to start operations of the new regional airline named, Thai Smile, from July 1, 2012, to tap strong demand for air traffic in Asia and win back market share in the wake of fierce competition in the region.

The launch timeframe is four to five months,[louis vuitton outlet](http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/ "http://www.authenticoutletbags.com/"), delayed from the previous schedule in March or April 2012.

Chairman Ampon Kittiampon said the new airline would fly to domestic cities in the first year of operations before expanding its destinations into Southeast Asian countries as well as China and India in 2013, when it expected to make profit.

EXPANSION PLAN

The wholly owned mid-tier carrier will operate with 11 Airbus 320s and cover journeys with an average flight time of 1-2 hours, Ampon said.

The mid-tier carrier is part of Thai Airways' expansion plan, an effort to turn itself around after years of losing market share in a region where swelling middle classes,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), fast economic growth and liberalised air policies provide opportunities for higher earnings.

Thai Air,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), with a market value of $2 billion, is 51 percent owned by Thailand's Finance Ministry and competes with bigger rivals like Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) and Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK).

Piyasvasti said the airline also planned to discuss with the new transport minister to get the go-ahead for the launch of a new budget carrier, Thai Tiger Airways, its joint venture with Singapore's Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd (TAHL.SI)

In 2010, Thai Airways formed the alliance with Tiger Airways to operate the new budget carrier, but the plan has been delayed, pending an approval from the transport ministry.

Thai Tiger, 51 percent owned by Thai Airways and 49 percent by Tiger, was originally supposed to have started in late March. Piyasvasti gave no details about the new launch date.

Thai Airways was still keen to raise its 39 percent stake in budget airline Nok Air to 49 percent by buying another 10 percent from state-owned Krung Thai Bank KTB.BK at 33 baht each, the president said.

Shares in Thai Airways slipped 2.7 percent at 0911 GMT, when the broad index .SETI was 1.9 percent lower.

# Top 10 ugly buildings to visit

n">(Reuters) - A recent opinion piece in the New York Times resurrected the age-old debate about whether ugly buildings deserved preservation if deemed historically important.

While the staff and travellers at online travel advisers Trippy.com (www.trippy.com) may be undecided on that issue, they can certainly tell you which buildings they'd put on the list for consideration. Here are their choices for the World's Top 10 Ugliest Buildings. Reuters has not endorsed this list:

1\. J. Edgar Hoover Building (FBI HQ); Washington, D.C.

This is reason alone to avoid the 10 Most Wanted list. Situated in the centre of the city, this dreary 1970s behemoth is almost unavoidable. Its days may be numbered as discussions about the department's relocation are rumoured to be swirling around the capital city.

2\. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum; Cleveland, Ohio

Even the architect was unhappy with this one. Upon the building's completion, a displeased I.M. Pei admitted himself there's little harmony in these conflicting shapes.

3\. Sharp Centre for Design; Toronto,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), Canada

Although some call it innovative, there are others who call it intolerable. While the building's black and white squares combined with pencil-like stilt supports make it look like a clubhouse for crossword puzzle enthusiasts, this building is actually part of the Ontario College of Art & Design.

4\. Aoyama Technical College; Shibuya, Japan

Ever wondered what you get when you cross a Transformers figurine, an oil well, and a curling rock? Now you know. The school's site offers that the building "represents a new order...through the tolerance of chaos."

5\. Geisel Library; University of California, San Diego, CA

This library is one of the best examples of Brutalist architecture ever built, and that's not a compliment. Named after Audrey and Theodor Geisel (better known as Dr. Seuss), we think it would have been a whole lot prettier had its benefactor also been its architect.

6\. Chang Building ("The Elephant Tower"); Bangkok, Thailand

It's not that we think the design is that bad and we even like the intended humour. It's the half-hearted execution that turns this potentially fun idea from attraction to eyesore.

7\. Epi Apartments; Seattle, Washington

We're all for occasional quirkiness,[louis vuitton](http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/ "http://www.bestlouisvuitton.org/"), but in this case we're not sure how adding a bunch of almost intimidating, sharp-looking metal shapes onto an otherwise bland building enhances it. The building's website boldly refers to the structure as "The centre of the centre of the universe."

8\. Trump Tower; New York City, New York

When it was completed in the early 80s it was considered the signature building of its time...and that's part of the problem. Downright dull on the outside,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org"), dizzyingly gaudy on the inside, this outdated building is generally only visited by tourists as it is almost universally avoided by actual New Yorkers.

9\. The Pixel Building; Melbourne, Australia

Yes,[gucci outlet online](http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.onlineguccioutlet.net/"), the building is carbon neutral, but how many Olympic mascot pins had to die to make it? While we love that the building is self-sufficient (they even collect their own rain water on the roof), we just wish it were a tad more subtle.

10\. Royal National Theatre; London, U.K.

Yes,[authentic gucci outlet](http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/ "http://www.authenticguccioutlet.org/"), Shakespeare wrote that "All the world's a stage..." but he might not have had he lived to see 1970s. While we love the idea of the theatre and the world-class productions mounted here,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/"), our feelings don't quite extend to the actual building.

# Jimmy Kimmel goes head-to-head with Leno, Letterman

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Comedian Jimmy Kimmel will go head to head with late- night talk show hosts Jay Leno and David Letterman when his TV program moves to the 11:35 pm time slot, sparking a fight for viewers among the three comedians.

ABC television said on Tuesday that the move from the midnight hour for "Jimmy Kimmel Live,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/")," which saw a 3 percent rise in total viewers last season, means ABC News magazine "Nightline" will shift to 12:35 a.m.

# Michael J. Fox to star in TV comedy as dad with Parkinson's

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Michael J. Fox, who stepped back from full-time acting in 2000 to focus on fighting Parkinson's disease,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), will star in a new TV comedy loosely based on his own life suffering from the illness.

NBC television said on Monday it had ordered a full 22 episodes of an untitled comedy series starring the "Spin City" and "Back to the Future" actor for the fall of 2013.

The show will feature Fox as a husband and father of three from New York City dealing with family, career,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), and challenges including the degenerative nervous system disorder, Parkinson's disease.

"He (Fox) is utterly relatable, optimistic,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), and in a class by himself, and I have no doubt that the character he will create - and the vivid family characters surrounding him - will be both instantly recognizable and hilarious,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-

Fox,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), 51, made his name in the 1980s TV comedy "Family Ties" and as teen adventurer Marty McFly in the "Back to the Future" movie franchise.

He later starred in TV political comedy "Spin City," winning multiple acting awards, but semi-retired from acting in 2000 as his symptoms of Parkinson's worsened and he focused his efforts on research for a cure.

In recent years, the Canadian actor has done voice-over work for movies like "Stuart Little" and has guest starred in TV shows like the comedy "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and legal drama "The Good Wife."

Filming for the new sitcom will begin this year,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), with casting for other roles to be announced later, NBC said.

# Pioneering comedian Phyllis Diller dies at age 95

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Comedian Phyllis Diller, the former housewife whose raucous cackle and jokes about her own looks made her one of America's first female stand-up comedy stars,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), died in her sleep on Monday at age 95, her longtime manager said.

Diller was found in her bed at her home in the affluent Brentwood section of Los Angeles by her son, Perry, who had come to visit her, manager Milt Suchin said.

"She had a smile on her face,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), as you'd expect," Suchin told Reuters.

Her publicist, Fred Wostbrock, called her "a true pioneer" and "the first lady of stand-up comedy."

A friend and fellow comic, Joan Rivers,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), said on Monday that Diller cleared a path for a younger generation of female stand-up artists to trade on their jokes alone.

"Phyllis Diller was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny," Rivers said in a message posted through Twitter.

Diller created an indelible persona with her distinctive braying laugh, a cigarette holder, teased hair,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), outlandish costumes and a fictional lout of a husband she called Fang.

Her act consisted of rapid-fire jokes and one-liners that often spoofed social pretenses by poking fun at herself ("I went bathing nude on the beach the other day; it took me 20 minutes to get arrested") as well as a world of invented characters.

In addition to husband Fang - "What would you call a man with one tooth that was 2 inches long?" - there was her mother-in-law Moby Dick, her skinny sister-in-law Captain Bligh and her neighbor Mrs. Clean.

Diller prided herself on keeping her jokes tightly written and boasted that she held a world record for getting 12 laughs a minute.

A late-bloomer by show business standards, Diller got her start at age 37,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), making her debut at San Francisco's Purple Onion in 1955 as she broke into the male-dominated comedy circuit. Her first national exposure came as a contestant on Groucho Marx's TV quiz show "You Bet Your Life."

At that time Diller was a housewife who had raised five children, as well as a newspaper columnist, publicist and radio writer.

She discovered a flair for stand-up jokes at school parent-teacher meetings and similar gatherings and decided to make comedy a career at the urging of her then-husband, Sherwood Diller. The couple divorced in 1965 and a second marriage to singer Warde Donovan ended 10 years later.

Diller gradually adopted the props, zany wardrobe and stage persona that would become her trademark.

FROM HOUSEWIFE TO COMIC

"If I showed you my opening night photo, I looked like the woman next door," Diller once said. "And it took me a while to realize that people don't pay to see the woman next door. They can look at her for nothing."

A series of TV appearances followed and Diller soon became an instantly recognized star. She made her movie debut in 1961 with a small part in Elia Kazan's "Splendor in the Grass" and played the title role in a 1970 Broadway production of "Hello Dolly!"

Diller also developed a close friendship with the late comedy great Bob Hope and co-starred with him in three movies. She was a frequent guest on his television shows and accompanied him on a Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Vietnam.

Another contemporary of Diller, stand-up veteran Don Rickles, saluted her as a "great comedienne" whose "memorable teaming with Bob Hope brought female comics to the forefront."

Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that Diller was "the queen of the one-liners" and Whoopi Goldberg called her a "true original."

Diller, who was an accomplished pianist, built a career around lampooning her looks but she also spent a fortune perfecting them. By her count, she had more than 20 plastic surgeries.

Diller, who titled her 2005 autobiography "Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse," counted her ability to laugh at herself as one of her greatest comic assets. In a 2004 interview with Reuters she said she regarded her audiences as her greatest teacher.

"I let them laugh with me, at me,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), which makes the audience very comfortable," she said. "I've learned everything from them. ... You're a comic and you're not a success until you hear laughter."

In later years, she suffered from heart problems and fractured her pelvis in a fall but continued to work in clubs and on television well into her 80s. She provided the voice of an insect in the 1998 animated movie "A Bug's Life, appeared in the 2005 comedy documentary "The Aristocrats" and supplied the voice of Peter's mother in 2006-2007 episodes of the cartoon TV series "Family Guy."

Suchin said she made a guest appearance last year on the daytime drama "The Bold and the Beautiful."

Diller and her first husband had five children. (Additional reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Will Dunham and Bill Trott)

# Clues sought in suicide of film director Tony Scott

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investigators sought clues on Monday to what prompted British-born filmmaker Tony Scott to take his own life in Los Angeles, while much of Hollywood focused on an unconfirmed news report that he was suffering from brain cancer.

Scott, director of such blockbuster films as "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop II,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," jumped to his death on Sunday from a suspension bridge over Los Angeles Harbor, leaving behind a suicide note in his office and a list in his car of people to contact, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said.

Medical examiners were scheduled on Monday to perform an autopsy on Scott's body, which was recovered from the harbor nearly three hours after he jumped in, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said.

Results of the exam will likely be kept confidential until toxicology and other tests are completed,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), he said.

Winter said he could not confirm an ABC News report that said the filmmaker, the younger brother of fellow director and three-time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott, had inoperable brain cancer. The report cited an unidentified source close to Scott.

Asked whether the suicide note found by friends in Scott's office or any other writings referred to an illness, Winter said, "not to my knowledge." Authorities have not disclosed the content of the note.

He also said investigators had no theories about what led Scott, who was 68, to take his own life.

A spokeswoman for Scott confirmed his death on Sunday night and asked that the media respect his family's privacy.

Members of the film industry expressed shock at the death of one of Hollywood's most prolific and bankable producer-directors with reactions from Tom Cruise,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Ron Howard and others.

Cruise, who shot to stardom in Scott's "Top Gun" in 1986, described him as "my dear friend" and said in a statement: "I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.

"No more Tony Scott movies. Tragic day," Ron Howard, the Oscar-winning director behind "A Beautiful Mind," said in a Twitter message. Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted that he was "taking a moment to reflect on Tony Scott's life & work."

Gene Hackman, who starred in Scott's "Enemy of the State" and "Crimson Tide", remembered him as "always sensitive to the needs of an actor. We've lost a wonderful, creative talent."

Scott was seen parking his car on the Vincent Thomas Bridge and leaping into the water at about 12:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT) on Sunday, according to Lieutenant Joe Bale, a watch commander for the coroner's office.

Bale said the body was recovered from the harbor shortly before 3 p.m. (2200 GMT) and subsequently identified as being that of the filmmaker.

MAN IN THE RED CAP

Scott, frequently seen behind the camera in his signature faded red baseball cap, directed more than two dozen movies and television shows and produced nearly 50 titles.

He built a reputation for muscular but stylish high-octane thrillers that showcased some of Hollywood's biggest stars in a body of work that dated to the 1980s and established him as one of the most successful action directors in the business.

Two of his biggest hits were the 1986 fighter jet adventure "Top Gun," which starred Tom Cruise as a hot-shot pilot, and the 1987 Eddie Murphy comedy "Beverly Hills Cop II."

Other directing credits include the 1990 racing drama "Days of Thunder," which also featured Cruise; the 1995 submarine thriller "Crimson Tide," co-starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman; and the 1998 spy thriller "Enemy of the State," which paired Hackman and Will Smith.

Washington became Scott's most frequent star, appearing in four other films including a 2009 remake of subway hostage thriller "The Taking of the Pelham 1 2 3," co-starring John Travolta, and the 2010 runaway-train blockbuster, "Unstoppable."

He got his start making TV commercials for his older brother's London-based production company, Ridley Scott Associates, and moved into movies for television and film.

His feature directorial debut, 1983 vampire movie "The Hunger" starring British rocker David Bowie and French actress Catherine Deneuve, was a flop that later became a cult favorite. Scott bounced back three years later with "Top Gun."

The brothers later formed a film company, Scott Free Productions,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), that made many of their films and TV shows.

The two were executive producers of two successful prime-time television dramas, "Numb3rs," which ran on CBS from 2005 to 2010, and "The Good Wife," which is still running on CBS.

Filmmaker Richard Kelly, who wrote the screenplay for Scott's 2005 film "Domino,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/")," joined the thousands of online tributes on Monday.

"Working with Tony Scott was like a glorious road trip to Vegas on desert back roads, a wild man behind the wheel, grinning," Kelly said.

Kevin Costner, who worked with Scott on 1990 movie "Revenge" said: "Tony was one of the good guys. He was a man's man who lived life as hard and as full as anyone I've ever met,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org
/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-
vuitton-c-1.html"), but there was always a sweetness to his toughness."

Actor Val Kilmer, who appeared in both "Top Gun" and the 1993 film "True Romance," called Scott "the kindest film director I ever worked for," and U.S. film critic Roger Ebert called him "an inspired craftsman."

Scott is survived by his third wife, Donna, with whom he had two children.

# San Francisco flower power singer Scott McKenzie dead at 7

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scott McKenzie, whose 1967 recording of "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)" came to encapsulate the hippie movement,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), has died in Los Angeles at the age of 73.

A message on his official website said McKenzie had been ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), a disease affecting the nervous system,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), and died at home on Saturday.

"San Francisco,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," written by the late John Phillips of California band The Mamas and The Papas,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), became a worldwide hit in 1967 and is credited with bringing thousands of young people to the city in search of flower power and free love.

McKenzie said on the website that the song "was not so much about the city itself, but about an idea. It was more about the Monterey Pop Festival."

The singer followed tens of thousands of young people by dropping out of mainstream society in the late 1960s and moving to Virginia for 10 years following his hit song.

In the 1980s and 1990s he joined The Mamas and the Papas and toured with them until the group disbanded.

"Scott was in and out of hospital since 2010 after falling ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome, a disease affecting the nervous system,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/")," his website said. "It is thought he may have had a heart attack in early August 2012\. Staff did not want him to leave the hospital, but he wanted to be at home and passed away on 18th August 2012."

# Michael J. Fox to star in TV comedy as dad with Parkinson's

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Michael J.

# Classical Brits to honor U.S. film composer Williams

LONDON (Reuters) - Five-time Oscar winning film composer John Williams will receive a lifetime achievement honor from the Classical Brit Awards in London in October, organizers said on Tuesday.

Williams won his first Academy Award more than 40 years ago with "Fiddler on the Roof", and went on to earn the famous statuette again with "Jaws", "Star Wars",[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "Schindler's List".

Including those wins, he was nominated for an Oscar nearly 50 times, reflecting his place at the pinnacle of soundtrack composition.

The 80-year-old American is still going strong, composing the music for the upcoming film "Lincoln" which is due to hit U.S. theatres late this year.

"For many,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-
vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-
vuitton-c-1.html"), the first introduction to large-scale orchestral music was a cinematic experience," said Dickon Stainer and Barry McCann, co-chairmen of the Classic BRIT Awards committee,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), in a joint statement.

"From the film scores of William Walton, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Erich Korngold and others to the modern day composer, their sheer emotive power has thrilled audiences for decades.

"John Williams has crafted some of the most memorable film scores for over half a century and we are delighted that he has kindly accepted the Lifetime Achievement award in honor of his fine work."

As well as scoring dozens of films, Williams has produced 130 studio albums,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), 49 compilation albums and 23 singles, according to the Brits.

With a total of 47 Academy Award nominations,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), he is the second most short-listed individual after Walt Disney.

The Classical Brits,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), sponsored by Mastercard, will be held at London's Royal Albert Hall on October 2.

At that time Diller was a housewife who had raised five children, as well as a newspaper columnist,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), publicist and radio writer.

She discovered a flair for stand-up jokes at school parent-teacher meetings and similar gatherings and decided to make comedy a career at the urging of her then-husband, Sherwood Diller. The couple divorced in 1965 and a second marriage to singer Warde Donovan ended 10 years later.

Diller gradually adopted the props, zany wardrobe and stage persona that would become her trademark.

FROM HOUSEWIFE TO COMIC

"If I showed you my opening night photo, I looked like the woman next door," Diller once said. "And it took me a while to realize that people don't pay to see the woman next door. They can look at her for nothing."

A series of TV appearances followed and Diller soon became an instantly recognized star. She made her movie debut in 1961 with a small part in Elia Kazan's "Splendor in the Grass" and played the title role in a 1970 Broadway production of "Hello Dolly!"

Diller also developed a close friendship with the late comedy great Bob Hope and co-starred with him in three movies. She was a frequent guest on his television shows and accompanied him on a Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Vietnam.

Another contemporary of Diller, stand-up veteran Don Rickles, saluted her as a "great comedienne" whose "memorable teaming with Bob Hope brought female comics to the forefront."

Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that Diller was "the queen of the one-liners" and Whoopi Goldberg called her a "true original."

Diller, who was an accomplished pianist, built a career around lampooning her looks but she also spent a fortune perfecting them. By her count, she had more than 20 plastic surgeries.

Diller, who titled her 2005 autobiography "Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse," counted her ability to laugh at herself as one of her greatest comic assets. In a 2004 interview with Reuters she said she regarded her audiences as her greatest teacher.

"I let them laugh with me, at me, which makes the audience very comfortable," she said. "I've learned everything from them. ... You're a comic and you're not a success until you hear laughter."

In later years,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), she suffered from heart problems and fractured her pelvis in a fall but continued to work in clubs and on television well into her 80s. She provided the voice of an insect in the 1998 animated movie "A Bug's Life, appeared in the 2005 comedy documentary "The Aristocrats" and supplied the voice of Peter's mother in 2006-2007 episodes of the cartoon TV series "Family Guy."

Suchin said she made a guest appearance last year on the daytime drama "The Bold and the Beautiful."

# Grammys go country for nominations concert

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Grammys are heading to Nashville,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), the capital of country music,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), for the first time to announce nominations for the biggest awards in the music industry, organizers said on Tuesday.

The Recording Academy said the show, which intersperses the naming of nominees with performances from leading musicians, will air live on the CBS television network on Dec 5.

Grammy organizers began televising the nominations in a live show five years ago in a bid to boost TV viewership for the annual Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles in February.

In previous years, the nominations concert took place in Los Angeles. But the Recording Academy president, Neil Portnow,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), said it was time to celebrate Nashville's musical heritage.

"Nashville's rich musical and cultural history is so important and vital to our industry,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), and indeed to the world," Portnow said in a statement.

Nashville, home to the Grand Ole Opry and dozens of recording studios, is considered the cultural center of country music,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), which has spawned dozens of young cross-over Grammy-winning artists in recent years such as Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood and the group, Lady Antebellum.

The 55th annual Grammy Awards will be held in Los Angeles on Feb 10,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), 2013.

# Pioneering comedian Phyllis Diller dies at age 95

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Comedian Phyllis Diller, the former housewife whose raucous cackle and jokes about her own looks made her one of America's first female stand-up comedy stars, died in her sleep on Monday at age 95,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), her longtime manager said.

Diller was found in her bed at her home in the affluent Brentwood section of Los Angeles by her son, Perry, who had come to visit her, manager Milt Suchin said.

"She had a smile on her face, as you'd expect," Suchin told Reuters.

Her publicist,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), Fred Wostbrock, called her "a true pioneer" and "the first lady of stand-up comedy."

A friend and fellow comic,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), Joan Rivers, said on Monday that Diller cleared a path for a younger generation of female stand-up artists to trade on their jokes alone.

"Phyllis Diller was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny," Rivers said in a message posted through Twitter.

Diller created an indelible persona with her distinctive braying laugh, a cigarette holder,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), teased hair, outlandish costumes and a fictional lout of a husband she called Fang.

Her act consisted of rapid-fire jokes and one-liners that often spoofed social pretenses by poking fun at herself ("I went bathing nude on the beach the other day; it took me 20 minutes to get arrested") as well as a world of invented characters.

In addition to husband Fang - "What would you call a man with one tooth that was 2 inches long?" - there was her mother-in-law Moby Dick, her skinny sister-in-law Captain Bligh and her neighbor Mrs. Clean.

Diller prided herself on keeping her jokes tightly written and boasted that she held a world record for getting 12 laughs a minute.

A late-bloomer by show business standards, Diller got her start at age 37, making her debut at San Francisco's Purple Onion in 1955 as she broke into the male-dominated comedy circuit. Her first national exposure came as a contestant on Groucho Marx's TV quiz show "You Bet Your Life."

At that time Diller was a housewife who had raised five children, as well as a newspaper columnist, publicist and radio writer.

She discovered a flair for stand-up jokes at school parent-teacher meetings and similar gatherings and decided to make comedy a career at the urging of her then-husband, Sherwood Diller. The couple divorced in 1965 and a second marriage to singer Warde Donovan ended 10 years later.

# Fox studio to distribute Dreamworks Animation films

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - 20th Century Fox movie studio will distribute animated feature films from "Kung Fu Panda" maker Dreamworks Animation for the next five years, the studios announced on Monday.

Fox is taking over the role currently played by Viacom unit Paramount Pictures, which has been distributing Dreamworks Animation films for a fee of about 8 percent of revenue from each movie.

Fox will distribute the films for the same fee, Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg told reporters on a conference call.

But the new arrangement is more favorable, he said,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), because both studios can take advantage of lower costs from digital distribution.

Under the existing deal, Paramount received about $40 million in 2011 from Dreamworks Animation, according to a source familiar with the arrangement.

Fox, a unit of News Corp, will distribute the studio's films for five years starting in 2013,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), including next year's "The Croods" and "Turbo." Fox has its own animated slate of films,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), including the successful "Ice Age" franchise.

The fourth "Ice Age" film has grossed $796.5 million worldwide since it hit theaters in June.

Katzenberg said he was also talking with Fox about the possibility of distributing a family-oriented cable channel he envisions using characters from Classic Media such as "Casper," "Rocky and Bullwinkle,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," and "Lassie" alongside Dreamworks franchises such as "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda."

Katzenberg's company acquired Classic Media in July for $155 million.

"We have had conversations with the Fox team about this," Katzenberg said,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), adding that if his studio and Fox do not reach a deal,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), Dreamworks is free to discuss the idea with other distributors.

At Paramount, the studio is trying to build its own animated offerings as it loses the Dreamworks Animation films and has cut the number of live action movies it produces. Last year's "Rango" from Paramount, about a chameleon in the Wild West, won the Academy Award for best animated feature and rang up sales of $245.4 million around the world.

# San Francisco flower power singer Scott McKenzie dead at 7

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scott McKenzie,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), whose 1967 recording of "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)" came to encapsulate the hippie movement, has died in Los Angeles at the age of 73.

A message on his official website said McKenzie had been ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), a disease affecting the nervous system,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), and died at home on Saturday.

"San Francisco," written by the late John Phillips of California band The Mamas and The Papas,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), became a worldwide hit in 1967 and is credited with bringing thousands of young people to the city in search of flower power and free love.

McKenzie said on the website that the song "was not so much about the city itself,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), but about an idea. It was more about the Monterey Pop Festival."

The singer followed tens of thousands of young people by dropping out of mainstream society in the late 1960s and moving to Virginia for 10 years following his hit song.

In the 1980s and 1990s he joined The Mamas and the Papas and toured with them until the group disbanded.

"Scott was in and out of hospital since 2010 after falling ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), a disease affecting the nervous system," his website said. "It is thought he may have had a heart attack in early August 2012\. Staff did not want him to leave the hospital, but he wanted to be at home and passed away on 18th August 2012."

# Clues sought in suicide of film director Tony Scott

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investigators sought clues on Monday to what prompted British-born filmmaker Tony Scott to take his own life in Los Angeles, while much of Hollywood focused on an unconfirmed news report that he was suffering from brain cancer.

Scott, director of such blockbuster films as "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop II," jumped to his death on Sunday from a suspension bridge over Los Angeles Harbor, leaving behind a suicide note in his office and a list in his car of people to contact, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office said.

Medical examiners were scheduled on Monday to perform an autopsy on Scott's body, which was recovered from the harbor nearly three hours after he jumped in, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said.

Results of the exam will likely be kept confidential until toxicology and other tests are completed, he said.

Winter said he could not confirm an ABC News report that said the filmmaker, the younger brother of fellow director and three-time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott, had inoperable brain cancer. The report cited an unidentified source close to Scott.

Asked whether the suicide note found by friends in Scott's office or any other writings referred to an illness, Winter said, "not to my knowledge." Authorities have not disclosed the content of the note.

He also said investigators had no theories about what led Scott, who was 68, to take his own life.

A spokeswoman for Scott confirmed his death on Sunday night and asked that the media respect his family's privacy.

Members of the film industry expressed shock at the death of one of Hollywood's most prolific and bankable producer-directors with reactions from Tom Cruise, Ron Howard and others.

Cruise, who shot to stardom in Scott's "Top Gun" in 1986, described him as "my dear friend" and said in a statement: "I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable.

"No more Tony Scott movies. Tragic day,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," Ron Howard,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), the Oscar-winning director behind "A Beautiful Mind," said in a Twitter message. Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted that he was "taking a moment to reflect on Tony Scott's life & work."

Gene Hackman, who starred in Scott's "Enemy of the State" and "Crimson Tide", remembered him as "always sensitive to the needs of an actor. We've lost a wonderful, creative talent."

Scott was seen parking his car on the Vincent Thomas Bridge and leaping into the water at about 12:30 p.m. local time (1930 GMT) on Sunday, according to Lieutenant Joe Bale, a watch commander for the coroner's office.

Bale said the body was recovered from the harbor shortly before 3 p.m. (2200 GMT) and subsequently identified as being that of the filmmaker.

MAN IN THE RED CAP

Scott, frequently seen behind the camera in his signature faded red baseball cap, directed more than two dozen movies and television shows and produced nearly 50 titles.

He built a reputation for muscular but stylish high-octane thrillers that showcased some of Hollywood's biggest stars in a body of work that dated to the 1980s and established him as one of the most successful action directors in the business.

Two of his biggest hits were the 1986 fighter jet adventure "Top Gun," which starred Tom Cruise as a hot-shot pilot, and the 1987 Eddie Murphy comedy "Beverly Hills Cop II."

Other directing credits include the 1990 racing drama "Days of Thunder," which also featured Cruise; the 1995 submarine thriller "Crimson Tide," co-starring Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman; and the 1998 spy thriller "Enemy of the State," which paired Hackman and Will Smith.

Washington became Scott's most frequent star,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), appearing in four other films including a 2009 remake of subway hostage thriller "The Taking of the Pelham 1 2 3,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," co-starring John Travolta, and the 2010 runaway-train blockbuster, "Unstoppable."

He got his start making TV commercials for his older brother's London-based production company, Ridley Scott Associates, and moved into movies for television and film.

His feature directorial debut, 1983 vampire movie "The Hunger" starring British rocker David Bowie and French actress Catherine Deneuve, was a flop that later became a cult favorite. Scott bounced back three years later with "Top Gun."

The brothers later formed a film company,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), Scott Free Productions, that made many of their films and TV shows.

The two were executive producers of two successful prime-time television dramas, "Numb3rs," which ran on CBS from 2005 to 2010, and "The Good Wife," which is still running on CBS.

Filmmaker Richard Kelly, who wrote the screenplay for Scott's 2005 film "Domino," joined the thousands of online tributes on Monday.

"Working with Tony Scott was like a glorious road trip to Vegas on desert back roads, a wild man behind the wheel, grinning," Kelly said.

Kevin Costner, who worked with Scott on 1990 movie "Revenge" said: "Tony was one of the good guys. He was a man's man who lived life as hard and as full as anyone I've ever met, but there was always a sweetness to his toughness."

Actor Val Kilmer,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), who appeared in both "Top Gun" and the 1993 film "True Romance," called Scott "the kindest film director I ever worked for," and U.S. film critic Roger Ebert called him "an inspired craftsman."

Scott is survived by his third wife, Donna, with whom he had two children.

# Classical Brits to honor U.S. film composer Williams

LONDON (Reuters) - Five-time Oscar winning film composer John Williams will receive a lifetime achievement honor from the Classical Brit Awards in London in October, organizers said on Tuesday.

Williams won his first Academy Award more than 40 years ago with "Fiddler on the Roof", and went on to earn the famous statuette again with "Jaws",[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), "Star Wars", "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "Schindler's List".

Including those wins,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), he was nominated for an Oscar nearly 50 times, reflecting his place at the pinnacle of soundtrack composition.

The 80-year-old American is still going strong, composing the music for the upcoming film "Lincoln" which is due to hit U.S. theatres late this year.

"For many, the first introduction to large-scale orchestral music was a cinematic experience," said Dickon Stainer and Barry McCann,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), co- chairmen of the Classic BRIT Awards committee, in a joint statement.

"From the film scores of William Walton, Ralph Vaughan Williams,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Erich Korngold and others to the modern day composer, their sheer emotive power has thrilled audiences for decades.

"John Williams has crafted some of the most memorable film scores for over half a century and we are delighted that he has kindly accepted the Lifetime Achievement award in honor of his fine work."

As well as scoring dozens of films,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), Williams has produced 130 studio albums, 49 compilation albums and 23 singles, according to the Brits.

With a total of 47 Academy Award nominations, he is the second most short- listed individual after Walt Disney.

The Classical Brits,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), sponsored by Mastercard, will be held at London's Royal Albert Hall on October 2.

# Michael J. Fox to star in TV comedy as dad with Parkinson's

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Michael J. Fox,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), who stepped back from full-time acting in 2000 to focus on fighting Parkinson's disease, will star in a new TV comedy loosely based on his own life suffering from the illness.

NBC television said on Monday it had ordered a full 22 episodes of an untitled comedy series starring the "Spin City" and "Back to the Future" actor for the fall of 2013.

The show will feature Fox as a husband and father of three from New York City dealing with family,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), career,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), and challenges including the degenerative nervous system disorder, Parkinson's disease.

"He (Fox) is utterly relatable, optimistic, and in a class by himself, and I have no doubt that the character he will create - and the vivid family characters surrounding him - will be both instantly recognizable and hilarious,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement.

Fox,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), 51, made his name in the 1980s TV comedy "Family Ties" and as teen adventurer Marty McFly in the "Back to the Future" movie franchise.

He later starred in TV political comedy "Spin City," winning multiple acting awards, but semi-retired from acting in 2000 as his symptoms of Parkinson's worsened and he focused his efforts on research for a cure.

In recent years,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), the Canadian actor has done voice-over work for movies like "Stuart Little" and has guest starred in TV shows like the comedy "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and legal drama "The Good Wife."

Filming for the new sitcom will begin this year, with casting for other roles to be announced later, NBC said.

# Classical Brits to honor U.S. film composer Williams

LONDON (Reuters) - Five-time Oscar winning film composer John Williams will receive a lifetime achievement honor from the Classical Brit Awards in London in October,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), organizers said on Tuesday.

Williams won his first Academy Award more than 40 years ago with "Fiddler on the Roof", and went on to earn the famous statuette again with "Jaws", "Star Wars",[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "Schindler's List".

Including those wins, he was nominated for an Oscar nearly 50 times, reflecting his place at the pinnacle of soundtrack composition.

The 80-year-old American is still going strong, composing the music for the upcoming film "Lincoln" which is due to hit U.S. theatres late this year.

"For many,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the first introduction to large- scale orchestral music was a cinematic experience," said Dickon Stainer and Barry McCann,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), co-chairmen of the Classic BRIT Awards committee,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), in a joint statement.

"From the film scores of William Walton, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Erich Korngold and others to the modern day composer,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), their sheer emotive power has thrilled audiences for decades.

"John Williams has crafted some of the most memorable film scores for over half a century and we are delighted that he has kindly accepted the Lifetime Achievement award in honor of his fine work."

As well as scoring dozens of films, Williams has produced 130 studio albums, 49 compilation albums and 23 singles, according to the Brits.

With a total of 47 Academy Award nominations, he is the second most short- listed individual after Walt Disney.

The Classical Brits, sponsored by Mastercard, will be held at London's Royal Albert Hall on October 2.

# Pioneering comedian Phyllis Diller dies at age 95

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Comedian Phyllis Diller, the former housewife whose raucous cackle and jokes about her own looks made her one of America's first female stand-up comedy stars, died in her sleep on Monday at age 95, her longtime manager said.

Diller was found in her bed at her home in the affluent Brentwood section of Los Angeles by her son, Perry, who had come to visit her, manager Milt Suchin said.

"She had a smile on her face, as you'd expect," Suchin told Reuters.

Her publicist, Fred Wostbrock, called her "a true pioneer" and "the first lady of stand-up comedy."

A friend and fellow comic, Joan Rivers, said on Monday that Diller cleared a path for a younger generation of female stand-up artists to trade on their jokes alone.

"Phyllis Diller was the last from an era that insisted a woman had to look funny in order to be funny," Rivers said in a message posted through Twitter.

Diller created an indelible persona with her distinctive braying laugh, a cigarette holder,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), teased hair, outlandish costumes and a fictional lout of a husband she called Fang.

Her act consisted of rapid-fire jokes and one-liners that often spoofed social pretenses by poking fun at herself ("I went bathing nude on the beach the other day; it took me 20 minutes to get arrested") as well as a world of invented characters.

In addition to husband Fang - "What would you call a man with one tooth that was 2 inches long?" - there was her mother-in-law Moby Dick, her skinny sister-in-law Captain Bligh and her neighbor Mrs. Clean.

Diller prided herself on keeping her jokes tightly written and boasted that she held a world record for getting 12 laughs a minute.

A late-bloomer by show business standards,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), Diller got her start at age 37,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), making her debut at San Francisco's Purple Onion in 1955 as she broke into the male-dominated comedy circuit. Her first national exposure came as a contestant on Groucho Marx's TV quiz show "You Bet Your Life."

At that time Diller was a housewife who had raised five children,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), as well as a newspaper columnist, publicist and radio writer.

She discovered a flair for stand-up jokes at school parent-teacher meetings and similar gatherings and decided to make comedy a career at the urging of her then-husband, Sherwood Diller. The couple divorced in 1965 and a second marriage to singer Warde Donovan ended 10 years later.

Diller gradually adopted the props, zany wardrobe and stage persona that would become her trademark.

FROM HOUSEWIFE TO COMIC

"If I showed you my opening night photo, I looked like the woman next door,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")," Diller once said. "And it took me a while to realize that people don't pay to see the woman next door. They can look at her for nothing."

A series of TV appearances followed and Diller soon became an instantly recognized star. She made her movie debut in 1961 with a small part in Elia Kazan's "Splendor in the Grass" and played the title role in a 1970 Broadway production of "Hello Dolly!"

Diller also developed a close friendship with the late comedy great Bob Hope and co-starred with him in three movies. She was a frequent guest on his television shows and accompanied him on a Christmas visit to U.S. troops in Vietnam.

Another contemporary of Diller,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html"), stand-up veteran Don Rickles, saluted her as a "great comedienne" whose "memorable teaming with Bob Hope brought female comics to the forefront."

Ellen DeGeneres tweeted that Diller was "the queen of the one-liners" and Whoopi Goldberg called her a "true original."

Diller, who was an accomplished pianist, built a career around lampooning her looks but she also spent a fortune perfecting them. By her count, she had more than 20 plastic surgeries.

Diller, who titled her 2005 autobiography "Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse," counted her ability to laugh at herself as one of her greatest comic assets. In a 2004 interview with Reuters she said she regarded her audiences as her greatest teacher.

"I let them laugh with me, at me, which makes the audience very comfortable," she said. "I've learned everything from them. ... You're a comic and you're not a success until you hear laughter."

In later years, she suffered from heart problems and fractured her pelvis in a fall but continued to work in clubs and on television well into her 80s. She provided the voice of an insect in the 1998 animated movie "A Bug's Life, appeared in the 2005 comedy documentary "The Aristocrats" and supplied the voice of Peter's mother in 2006-2007 episodes of the cartoon TV series "Family Guy."

Suchin said she made a guest appearance last year on the daytime drama "The Bold and the Beautiful."

Diller and her first husband had five children. (Additional reporting by Piya Sinha-Roy; Editing by Will Dunham and Bill Trott)

# Fox studio to distribute Dreamworks Animation films

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - 20th Century Fox movie studio will distribute animated feature films from "Kung Fu Panda" maker Dreamworks Animation for the next five years,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), the studios announced on Monday.

Fox is taking over the role currently played by Viacom unit Paramount Pictures,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), which has been distributing Dreamworks Animation films for a fee of about 8 percent of revenue from each movie.

Fox will
distribute the films for the same fee, Dreamworks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg told reporters on a conference call.

But the new arrangement is more favorable, he said, because both studios can take advantage of lower costs from digital distribution.

Under the existing deal, Paramount received about $40 million in 2011 from Dreamworks Animation, according to a source familiar with the arrangement.

Fox,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), a unit of News Corp,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), will distribute the studio's films for five years starting in 2013, including next year's "The Croods" and "Turbo." Fox has its own animated slate of films, including the successful "Ice Age" franchise.

The fourth "Ice Age" film has grossed $796.5 million worldwide since it hit theaters in June.

Katzenberg said he was also talking with Fox about the possibility of distributing a family-oriented cable channel he envisions using characters from Classic Media such as "Casper," "Rocky and Bullwinkle," and "Lassie" alongside Dreamworks franchises such as "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda."

Katzenberg's company acquired Classic Media in July for $155 million.

"We have had conversations with the Fox team about this," Katzenberg said, adding that if his studio and Fox do not reach a deal,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), Dreamworks is free to discuss the idea with other distributors.

At Paramount,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the studio is trying to build its own animated offerings as it loses the Dreamworks Animation films and has cut the number of live action movies it produces. Last year's "Rango" from Paramount, about a chameleon in the Wild West, won the Academy Award for best animated feature and rang up sales of $245.4 million around the world.

# San Francisco flower power singer Scott McKenzie dead at 7

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Scott McKenzie, whose 1967 recording of "San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)" came to encapsulate the hippie movement,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), has died in Los Angeles at the age of 73.

A message on his official website said McKenzie had been ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome, a disease affecting the nervous system, and died at home on Saturday.

"San Francisco,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," written by the late John Phillips of California band The Mamas and The Papas,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html"), became a worldwide hit in 1967 and is credited with bringing thousands of young people to the city in search of flower power and free love.

McKenzie said on the website that the song "was not so much about the city itself,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), but about an idea. It was more about the Monterey Pop Festival."

The singer followed tens of thousands of young people by dropping out of mainstream society in the late 1960s and moving to Virginia for 10 years following his hit song.

In the 1980s and 1990s he joined The Mamas and the Papas and toured with them until the group disbanded.

"Scott was in and out of hospital since 2010 after falling ill with Guillain- Barre Syndrome, a disease affecting the nervous system,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")," his website said. "It is thought he may have had a heart attack in early August 2012\.

# Michael J. Fox to star in TV comedy as dad with Parkinson's

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Actor Michael J. Fox, who stepped back from full-time acting in 2000 to focus on fighting Parkinson's disease,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html"), will star in a new TV comedy loosely based on his own life suffering from the illness.

NBC television said on Monday it had ordered a full 22 episodes of an untitled comedy series starring the "Spin City" and "Back to the Future" actor for the fall of 2013.

The show will feature Fox as a husband and father of three from New York City dealing with family,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), career,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), and challenges including the degenerative nervous system disorder, Parkinson's disease.

"He (Fox) is utterly relatable, optimistic, and in a class by himself, and I have no doubt that the character he will create - and the vivid family characters surrounding him - will be both instantly recognizable and hilarious,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-
vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-
vuitton-c-1.html")," NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement.

Fox, 51,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), made his name in the 1980s TV comedy "Family Ties" and as teen adventurer Marty McFly in the "Back to the Future" movie franchise.

He later starred in TV political comedy "Spin City," winning multiple acting awards,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), but semi-retired from acting in 2000 as his symptoms of Parkinson's worsened and he focused his efforts on research for a cure.

In recent years, the Canadian actor has done voice-over work for movies like "Stuart Little" and has guest starred in TV shows like the comedy "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and legal drama "The Good Wife."

Filming for the new sitcom will begin this year, with casting for other roles to be announced later, NBC said.

# Fox promotes broadcast TV executive Kevin Reilly

n">(Reuters) - Kevin Reilly has been promoted to chairman of entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Co, the network said on Monday, the latest move in a shuffle of News Corp's entertainment executives ahead of the company's split into two businesses next year.

He will be in charge of programming, scheduling,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), marketing, research and business affairs.

Reilly joined Fox in 2007 after a stint as NBC's president of entertainment. In his previous role as entertainment president at Fox, he oversaw the debut of hit comedies "Glee" and "New Girl" and singing competition "The X Factor" in Fox's prime-time lineup.

Fox trails CBS in total viewers but has ranked No. 1 among 18- to 49-year- olds,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/"), the group most prized by advertisers, for eight straight seasons.

Fox faces challenges in the coming season as "American Idol" has seen its audiences shrink over 11 seasons. While "Idol" remains the No. 1 non-sports broadcast on television, viewership dropped 30 percent for the season that ended in May,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), according to Nielsen ratings data.

In July, Reilly told TV critics that Fox may lose the 18- to 49-year-old age group to CBS,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), which will benefit from its broadcast of the Super Bowl next January.

Still, Reilly said he was optimistic about new comedy shows including "The Mindy Project" created by and starring "The Office" actress Mindy Kaling, and "Ben and Kate,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," a series about an odd-couple pair of siblings. To revive "Idol," the network signed pop superstar Mariah Carey as a judge.

Reilly takes over from Peter Rice,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), who was promoted in July to chairman and chief executive of Fox Networks Group, a job that involves overseeing sports and Fox's cable networks.

There has been much speculation in recent months about how News Corp will cram all of its executive talent into the new News Corp entertainment company after the split from its newspapers and publishing business.

Rupert Murdoch relented to pressure from investors to split off the company's newspapers and publishing from the entertainment arm to boost valuation of the entertainment assets, which were being discounted because of their association with the struggling newspaper business. The split is expected to be completed in 2013.

# Porn film production on hold after Los Angeles syphilis case

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A porn industry trade group has announced a U.S. moratorium on production of adult sex films after at least one Los Angeles actor tested positive for syphilis, adding to the pressure on porn producers to require the use of condoms on sets.

The actors can return to work in 10 days after taking antibiotics and doctors have recommended treating all adult film actors as a precaution, the Los Angeles-based Free Speech Coalition said in a statement on its website late on Monday.

It added that filming had been halted since the weekend.

"Clearly our industry's priority is the health and well-being of our performers,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," Diane Duke, the executive director of the Free Speech Coalition,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), said in the statement.

Porn producers in the Los Angeles area,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), which is the heart of the U.S. adult film industry and home to an estimated 1,000 performers,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), are under pressure to ensure condom use on sets to prevent the spread of the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Existing California workplace laws already mandate the use of condoms by porn performers,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), but critics say that statute is not specifically aimed at the industry and is widely flouted.

A Los Angeles ballot initiative in November will ask voters to require the county health department to require condom use by adult film performers.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a statement on Monday that it was "investigating recent reports of possible cases of syphilis in the adult film industry."

It was unclear exactly how many porn actors have tested positive for syphilis. The Free Speech Coalition said on its website that a single performer had tested positive for the disease.

But Peter Kerndt,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), the director of the county's sexually transmitted disease programs, told the Los Angeles Times in an article posted on its website on Friday that his agency had received reports of at least five possible cases.

Sarah Kissel, a spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health, declined on Tuesday to say how many cases had been reported to the county.

The nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation has led a campaign to involve local officials in regulating the use of condoms in the adult film industry. In January, it succeeded in persuading Los Angeles city officials to adopt a condom requirement for porn performers. The city is still determining how to enforce the policy, but it will not cover studio sound stages.

A ballot initiative in November, which resulted from a signature-gathering drive by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, would require county health officials to impose a more far-reaching requirement for condoms on porn sets, and that would apply to shoots in studio sound stages.

The Free Speech Coalition last year called for a temporary moratorium on filming after a performer tested positive for HIV. The actor was later found to not have the virus.

"He (Fox) is utterly relatable, optimistic, and in a class by himself, and I have no doubt that the character he will create - and the vivid family characters surrounding him - will be both instantly recognizable and hilarious,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/")," NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said in a statement.

Fox,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutlete.com/"), 51,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), made his name in the 1980s TV comedy "Family Ties" and as teen adventurer Marty McFly in the "Back to the Future" movie franchise.

He later starred in TV political comedy "Spin City," winning multiple acting awards, but semi-retired from acting in 2000 as his symptoms of Parkinson's worsened and he focused his efforts on research for a cure.

In recent years,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the Canadian actor has done voice- over work for movies like "Stuart Little" and has guest starred in TV shows like the comedy "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and legal drama "The Good Wife."

Filming for the new sitcom will begin this year, with casting for other roles to be announced later, NBC said.

Solange Knowles is one half of the coolest, most fashionable pair of sisters around. So it tickled us big time to hear that the DJ and model is the new face of American brand Madewell. J Crew's sister brand has previously had Britain's favourite cool girl Alexa Chung as the face of Madewell, a collection whose preppy-meets-granny chic styling couldn't have suited Le Chung more.

At last the Solange for Madewell pictures have arrived and they are absolutely GORGEOUS! The youngest Knowles looks perfectly at home in an array of colour popping separates, clashing prints and Madewell's signature vintage style classics - cardigans,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), shirts and knitwear a-plenty!

Our absolutely favourite look is the neon green strip cardigan paired with chambray shirt and black and white polka dot micro shorts. And check out Solange's ultra-toned legs,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/")! Jealous, us? Yes very!

# LFW AW '11 Report GILES Slide Image 7 Shows

,[pochette louis vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/")

**Giles Deacon's** show took place in the Royal Courts of Justice - a suitable severe and institutional setting with plenty of historical gravitas forthe show that was to follow. After a S/S collection of clashing neon and patterned jumpers we didn't know what to expect - apart from the hunch that Autumn would offer up, to paraphrase Monty Python - something completely different. And so it was. Strict,[Hogan Scarpe](http://www.hogansitaliann.com/ "http://www.hogansitaliann.com/"), disciplinarian **Giles**,[Sito Ufficiale Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), the alter ego of fun-loving, dinosaur bag toting **Giles** had created this collection. The first group of looks were high necked blouses,both fitted and full skirts in a stark combination of black and white. One was even cinched at the waist with black leather bindings. Then appeared a print - the first glimpse of colour; created from the painting,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), 'The Execution of Lady **Jane Grey'** which hangs in the National Gallery at the opposite end of the Strand. More colour came in the form of cocktail dresses and sweeping maxi dresses in a deep teal silk satin,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/sacs-louis-vuitton-c-1.html"), before the collection culminated with full-on ball gowns embellished with jet black **Swarovski** crystals and generous supplies of horse hair in gleaming glossy black orluxurious cream. Overall, a regal and magical collection,[sacs louis vuitton](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), definitely one to fuel every editor's imagination and inspire them for the coming season.

# Greek tourism rebound needs reforms to last

ATHENS (Reuters) - Tourists are flocking back to Greece's sun-drenched islands, drawn by sharply lower prices on offer for Aegean holidays, but the crisis-hit country will need tough reforms for the rebound in visitors to last.

Anxious to improve an image tarnished by news footage of bloody street protests, Greece's top earning sector must cut through the nation's endemic red tape, which scares away cruise companies and investors, and offer even better value for money.

Visitors to Greece's tranquil islands and ancient monuments account for nearly a sixth of the economy and one in five jobs, so a strong tourist sector is crucial to Athens' plan to emerge next year from its worst recession in four decades.

"We should not relax and be content with the fact that this looks like a good year ... we must focus on improving the value,[Louis Vuitton Borse](http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/ "http://www.louisvuittonborseoutleti.org/")," said Yannis Retsos,[Sac Louis Vuitton](http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/ "http://www.saclouisvuitton1.net/"), head of the Greek hoteliers' association, adding:

"We are pushing the government to make it easier to do business, to attract new funds: if you want to build a new hotel or add a swimming pool, it should be simple."

The number of tourists flying in to enjoy Greece's sunsets, picturesque villages, archaeological sites and Mediterranean cuisine has leapt by nearly 10 percent this year after two years in which income plunged by a fifth due to the global downturn, violent anti-austerity demonstrations in Athens and strikes.

The island of Rhodes, whose mediaeval city is popular with British and Scandinavian tourists, has seen a third more visitors, with arrivals on the island of Crete up 15 percent.

HOTEL PRICES LOWER

The surge in arrivals is largely due to low prices to entice visitors who were put off by the violence, which claimed the lives of three bank employees in one incident last May and strikes that left visitors stranded at ports and airports.

Hotel room rates have dropped by about 12 percent in the past two years, Retsos said,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), while inflation jumped, peaking at a 13-year high of 5.6 percent in September.

But Greece is still more expensive than Mediterranean competitors Egypt and Tunisia, which benefit from cheaper labour costs. These nations lost visitors due to the political unrest of the Arab Spring, but officials expect them to return soon.

"There is no way to try to be competitive only on price levels, because there will always be somebody who is cheaper than you," said George Drakopoulos, general manager of Greece's main tourism industry body SETE.

Half of the increase in arrivals is due to price cuts, he said with others coming back to Greece after cancelling last year due to unrest or avoiding North Africa due to the turmoil there. Israelis also seem to be choosing Greece over Turkey.

"We cannot cut prices any lower, that's why we push our members to offer better services, to increase the value for money, we ask the state to do better promotion, undergo reforms and improve infrastructures," Drakopoulos said.

Among key reforms needed were a land registry that holiday home buyers and investors can trust to boost real estate investment, and efforts to extend tourism beyond a three-month peak summer season focused on beach-goers.

Greece needs to expand from selling itself as a summer, beach-going destination to attract high-end tourists willing to pay more for cultural and culinary experiences and keen to travel out of the main summer season to discover Greece's Byzantine history or sample its wines, analysts say.

"Mykonos 20 years ago and Mykonos now is the same,[sacs Louis Vuitton Paris](http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/ "http://www.ssacslouisvuittonparis.com/"), the product hasn't changed, while Greece is competing with countries like Turkey and Croatia who have evolved their product," said Diego Iscaro, at IHS Global Insight, referring to the popular Cycladic destination famous for summer clubbing.

"You can extrapolate that to the rest of the economy," he said. "One way (to be more competitive) is to cut costs but they will have to look at innovation, offer higher-value products ... and expand to fast-growing economies."

In its July review of the 110-billion euro bailout that saved Greece from bankruptcy last year, the European Commission said Athens must agree by the end of August on a law to facilitate investment in resorts and vacation complexes, marinas and privatise state real estate.

RED TAPE AND TEAR GAS

But in a nation around the bottom of competitiveness indices because of stifling corruption and bureaucracy, reforms do not come easy, even in the prized tourism sector which ministers hope will lead the way in dragging Greece out of recession.

For instance, a 2010 law meant to boost earnings from the lucrative cruise ship business failed to reach its objective because of the many restrictions that remained in place, industry officials said.

More cruises now transit through Greece, said Drakopoulos, but fewer began their voyages from here because big firms feel stifled by over-burdensome bureaucracy. Passengers spend about five times more at the start-off point than on a stop-off.

"(Changing regulations governing cruises) is easy, has no cost, it's simply a new way of thinking but some people just have to open their eyes," Drakopoulos said.

Hoteliers, souvenir shop owners and tour operators also face the uncertainty that an upsurge in violent protests against the EU/IMF plan of tax hikes and wage cuts meant to pull Greece out of its debt crisis could once more scare people off.

Last month, after two days of highly-publicised clashes between protesters and police in Athens' central Syntagma square,[Sacs Louis Vuitton](http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/ "http://www.asacslouisvuittonfr.org/"), visitors cancelled nights in the city's hotels and bookings for the end of the summer slowed down.

"You kill the image, you damage the destination,[Hogan](http://www.hgsit.com/ "http://www.hgsit.com/"), it really hurts," said SETE's Drakopoulos.

Another possible negative could be a government decision to raise VAT paid by bars and restaurants to 23 from 13 percent, which industry officials warned could lead to owners simply not declaring income resulting in decreased revenue for the state.

If Greece succeeds in bringing in 10 percent more from tourism this year, the trend could help to start the containment of a recession seen at nearly 4 percent of GDP this year after a 4.5 percent contraction last year.

According to an unpublished government-commissioned paper by consultants, tourism could account for 20 percent of Greece's GDP and one in four jobs by 2020.

"Big crises are also an opportunity for change," the hotels' chief Retsos said. "We don't want to see just a one-year rebound, we want a sustainable rebound. It's not easy."
