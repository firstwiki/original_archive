## Field Layout

## Game Description

Each alliance was given 10 'floppies', which were fabric toroids filled with packing peanuts. The outer edge and the hole in the center of the toroid were covered in Velcro.

Floppies lifted off the ground at least 4 inches were worth _points. Floppies above 8 feet in the air were worth_ points.

Having your robot touching the puck and not touching the floor caused a 2x multiplier. The two common methods of scoring this multiplier were: Driving onto the puck or vertically lifting the robot using the two poles on the puck.

The puck could hold 2 robots, typically.

There might have been a multiplier if the puck was on your side of the field?
