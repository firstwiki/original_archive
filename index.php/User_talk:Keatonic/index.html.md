##  Hello!

Hello, and welcome to the FIRSTwiki! I'm Ryan Hall, Co-CEO of the Pascack Pi-
oneers, FRC Team 1676, and the main leader for reviving the wiki. First off,
thank you for helping us bring back this site, and hopefully make it a very
useful resource for teams by next build season. I see that you nominated
yourself for sysopship. While currently we only have the need for a small
amount of administrators, I would love to see you to continue editing pages
and contribute where ever possible. The wiki is always growing, so if you show
that you are dedicated to your work and know what you're doing, there will
very most likely be a promotion in your future. If you have any questions,
comments, or concerns, feel free to contact me.
