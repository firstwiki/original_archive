The [FLL Challenge](FLL_Challenge "FLL Challenge") theme for 2003 was Mission Mars. FLL teams were tasked to compete in the Robot Game, as well complete a Project to design a robotic expedition to answer a key question about Mars exploration.

The challenge was released in September, 2003 with the bulk of Official State tournaments occuring in December. The season was concluded by the [FLL Invitational](FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival") (now known as the FLL World Festival) which was held in conjunction with the FIRST Championship event in April 2004.

## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of Lego on it related to that year's theme. Examples included: MAV Launcher Launch; Habitation Modules Construction; Tetrahedron Base Deployment; etc. These were all missions that might need to be done on Mars as part of research about Mars or human habitation/settlement on Mars. In the robot game, a robot designed by the team and built entirely from Lego Mindstorms kits and Lego pieces had to autonomously complete the missions on the board. Each mission had a specific point value.

## The Project

The Research Project for Mission Mars asked teams to...

- Choose one of the missions from the Mission Mars challenge
