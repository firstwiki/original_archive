A **sensor** is a device that detects, or _senses_, the surrounding
environment. In terms of robotics, and specifically [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ), sensors enable the [robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) to better
understand what is around it and how to react. The types of sensors used in
FIRST are electrical, meaning that they send signals to the [Robot
Controller](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ) that is then
converted into some value for use by the program. There are two main types of
sensors, [analog](/index.php/Analog "Analog" ) and
[digital](/index.php/Digital "Digital" ). An analog sensor, such as a
[potentiometer](/index.php/Potentiometer "Potentiometer" ), will have a value
in the range of 0 to 1023 (10 bits). A digital sensor, such as a [limit
switch](/index.php/Limit_switch "Limit switch" ), is much more limited, only
having _off_ and _on_ states, represented by 0 and 1.

Sensors are important aspects of [programming](/index.php/Programming
"Programming" ), allowing truly complex robots that can react intelligently to
dynamic situations. The use of advanced sensors is often necessary to devlop
an effective [autonomous mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ),
though many other uses are possible. Sensors can count the number of rotations
of a particular wheel and then the program can adjust speed based on this
information; sensors can determine whether some apendage is fully extended,
and then shut off power to a motor; sensors can allow the robot to avoid
objects that the robot [operator](/index.php/Operator "Operator" ) might not
see.

The sensors included in the [kit of parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of
parts" ) are:

  * [IR sensor](/index.php/IR_sensor "IR sensor" )
  * [Banner sensor](/index.php?title=Banner_sensor&action=edit "Banner sensor" )
  * [Gyroscope](/index.php/Gyroscope "Gyroscope" )
  * [Current sensor](/index.php/Current_sensor "Current sensor" )
  * [Pressure sensor](/index.php/Pressure_switch "Pressure switch" )
  * [Accelerometer](/index.php/Accelerometer "Accelerometer" )
  * A vision system, currently the [CMUcam2](/index.php/CMUcam2 "CMUcam2" ). 
  * [Encoder](/index.php/Encoder "Encoder" )

See [electronics rules](/index.php?title=Electronics_rules&action=edit
"Electronics rules" ) for information on where and which sensors may be
bought, and the price limit on them.
