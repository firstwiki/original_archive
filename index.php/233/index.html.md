## History

  * History Example 


## Team projects

  * Project Example 

Every year, FIRST Team 233 creates a robot to compete in the official USFIRST
game competition for the year. We have contributed awesome robots, such as
Roccobot2k5 which won two regionals, as well as even more awesome robots, such
as Roccobot2k6. As well, we submit the animation, webdesign projects, and the
chairman's project to the USFIRST competition each year. In this way, we
procure awesomeness through inspiration and recognition in the fields of
science and technology.
