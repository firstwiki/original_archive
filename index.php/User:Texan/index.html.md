## Programming

For lack of anything better to put here, I'll put this.

I began programming when I bought myself the LEGO Mindstorms kit, around when
I was 9. I quickly out grew the language provided with the kit and moved on to
LegOS (now called BrickOS). LegOS is a C/C++ alternative firmware for the RCX,
so I had to learn C to be able to use it. After learning C, I then leanered
C++ and Java. In addition to those, I have also taught myself some Visual
Basic. So, in summary, if you have a question on syntax of something in a
language, come to me. I'm not the best for algorithms, but hey!...
