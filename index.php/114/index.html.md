## History

Team 114 was founded in 1997 by Quinn Hennig-Hance; in the past 2 years - it
has grown tremendously. Due to a large influx of relentless freshman who are
constantly under the influence of caffiene, team 114 has become better than in
previous years. Once known as one one park, the team is now placing quite well
in the regionals.

In 2006 - the team starts upon an ambitious plan to design a robot capable of
loading from both the group and the basket - the robot is also designed to
automatically track and calculate poofball trajectory. This enables the driver
to concentrate on driving - not aiming.
