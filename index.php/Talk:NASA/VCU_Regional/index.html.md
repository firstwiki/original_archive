Not the largest regional, says [user:Sciencewhiz](User:Sciencewhiz
"User:Sciencewhiz" )? Hrm... I was at it, and I could've sworn they announced
it being the largest -- well, at least having the most teams of all the other
regionals. Now granted, some of us might have been elsewhere on Saturday,
thanks to a certain virus whose name I won't mention ...

The Canadian Regional dwarves the VCU Regional with 75 registered teams in
2004. --[Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )

And the Canadian Regional had two fields as well. VCU was the largest several
years ago (2001 or 2002, maybe) but definetly not this year.

It's the largest in the US. I really can't imagine considering the Canadian
event a regional, as it is more like a mini-national. Oh, and at VCU they
certainly said it was the largest, but they we're clearly wrong.

Right now VCU has 64 teams, more than any other regional.
