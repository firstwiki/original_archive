Not the largest regional, says [user:Sciencewhiz](User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz")? Hrm... I was at it, and I could've sworn they announced it being the largest -- well, at least having the most teams of all the other regionals. Now granted, some of us might have been elsewhere on Saturday, thanks to a certain virus whose name I won't mention ... --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 20:27, 11 Jun 2004 (EDT)

The Canadian Regional dwarves the VCU Regional with 75 registered teams in

1. --[Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie")

And the Canadian Regional had two fields as well. VCU was the largest several years ago (2001 or 2002, maybe) but definetly not this year. --[Sciencewhiz](User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz") 20:45, 11 Jun 2004 (EDT)

It's the largest in the US. I really can't imagine considering the Canadian event a regional, as it is more like a mini-national. Oh, and at VCU they certainly said it was the largest, but they we're clearly wrong. --[Phrontist](User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist") 21:02, 11 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Right now VCU has 64 teams, more than any other regional.
