## Keaton Mantz

**Hello all,** I'm Keaton Mantz. I'm a Senior in high school and on the business and media team for Team #27, which is Team RUSH out of Clarkston, Michigan. 

I got involved in FIRST from my dad's friend, who runs a different team, in
2006, and joined Team RUSH in 2009. I'm a web developer and designer, but I
also do graphic design and _some_ programming. Throughout my four years on
Team RUSH, I've been on the 3D Studio Max animation team, Programming, and
Media and Management.

I'm a music enthusiast, as well as a producer of electronic music. I've
released three albums as of this writing, and continue to make more. I also
enjoy live-action combat games such as Dagorhir, Role Playing games like
Dungeons and Dragons (but only 3.5e!) as well as Massively Multiplayer Online
Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and DnD
Online.

If you would like to contact me, please use the email keatondm [at] gmail.com
and include FIRST somewhere in the subject.
