## Introduction

LEGO Mindstorms is a product of LEGO. It is the only platform used in the [FLL](FLL "FLL") program. It uses standard LEGO parts, and contains several motors and sensors to control a fully autonomous robot, such as used in FLL competition. Although there are several sets released by LEGO, only two are legal or practical for FLL use. These are the Robotics Invention System and the NXT.

## Robotics Invention System

The RIS (Robotics invention System) uses the [RCX](/index.php?title=RCX&action=edit "RCX") microcontroller. The microcontroller is compatible with three types of nine-volt LEGO motors, four types of LEGO sensors (touch, light, temperature, and rotation), and numerous OEM sensors. The RCX has three nine-volt motor outputs and three sensor inputs. It has an infrared communication port to download programs. The RCX is programmable using the Mindstorms RIS software, [Robolab](/index.php?title=Robolab&action=edit "Robolab") or the NQC language. Only RIS and Robolab are legal in the FLL competition. The RIS kit comes with two nine-volt LEGO mini-motors, a light sensor, and two touch sensors. It also includes over 700 lego technic parts, including many types of gears and wheels, with which to build a robot. Teams may expand their kit with any unaltered LEGO parts, but are limited to a set number of sensors and motors, depending on the rules of the game.

## NXT

The [NXT](NXT "NXT") set uses an improved microcontroller which incorporates USB and bluetooth technology, a new programming environment, and larger LCD screen. The RCX kit comes with stepper motors, a new touch sensor, a light sensor capable of detecting color as well as light intensity, a sound sensor, and a ultrasonic sensor. The NXT kit also comes with a compliment of LEGO Technic parts. Teams may expand their kit with any unaltered LEGO parts, but are limited to a set number of sensors and motors, depending on the rules of the game.

## Uses

LEGO Mindstorms is the official platform of FLL. Many schools use Mindstorms as an education tool independent of FLL. Also, like Vex, Mindstorms components are commonly used in prototyping by FRC teams.
