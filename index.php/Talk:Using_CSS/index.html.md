# Talk:Using CSS

Umm, are you sure you want to cover all of CSS? I dunno if this is the right
place for such a large topic. Maybe just link to a couple of good resources on
it. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:12, 6 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    Typically not a good idea to re-invent the wheel. Especially when there are so many great wheels out there. I'd talk about the major issues, if you would like ... but so far as how to implement them, refer them elsewhere. E.g., if you would like to mention syntax, make a general statement about it and shove them off to some other site. Unless you have something new, some intrigue before unthought of, this should probably be scaled back a tad. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 10:48, 7 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I talked to the kid, I told him exactly what you said, in fact, i think i even used the "reinvent the wheel" thing... I don't think he knows enough to even make such a new wheel, or even if he did, he wouldn't spend that much time, so no worries. He's a freshman, he'll learn in time. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 14:22, 7 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Some concerns:

  * Use of first person. 
  * Using ALL CAPS to format. Use headers, or bold instead. 
  * And, don't say "IN THIS ARTICLE..."

    I don't think "IN THIS ARTICLE..." is so bad (aside from formatting). Sure, in general articles it is considered (and should be) bad style ... but in howto-like articles (which I can only imagine this is), it is a good directive to the reader. If the reader comes here and already knows some CSS, he can judge whether he wants to finish the thing. Always a good idea to give an introduction to what you will talk about ... and howto articles can be informal (e.g., use of "you" is okay). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 10:52, 7 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Good luck on this huge project... :) I have my site up
[here](http://texan.homeunix.net/texan2/index.html
"http://texan.homeunix.net/texan2/index.html" ), which might give some
interesting things to talk about, if you would like examples. The site isn't
at all near complete, but the basic layout is. Some of the things in CSS I
used are:

  * positioning - Everything uses CSS, but the "shadowed" site title is interesting 
  * tag modicfication - all the h&amp; are modified to fit in with the site 
  * link states - the navagation bar uses link states to glow when you hover over a link
