# Drill motor

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

    _This entry describes the drill motors included in the 2003 and 2004 [kit of parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ). Earlier drill motors had a smaller [shaft](/index.php?title=Shaft&action=edit "Shaft" ) and were not as powerful._

Two drill motors and gearboxes were included with every [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ). The drill motor, along with
the [CIM motor](/index.php/CIM_motor "CIM motor" ), are the two most powerful
motors included by a significant margin. One of the two basic [skid
steer](/index.php/Skid_steer "Skid steer" ) [drive
trains](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train" ) included in the [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) utilizes one drill motor on
each side of the [robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ).

Included gearbox" )]

## Included gearbox

The drill motor is provided with the accompanying gearbox in the portable
drill that the motor comes from. It is a [planetary
gearbox](/index.php?title=Planetary_gearbox&action=edit "Planetary gearbox" )
with two [gears](/index.php?title=Gears&action=edit "Gears" ) with ratios of
_ratio here_ and _here_. The gearbox has a torque limiting clutch that can be
set to disengage the gearbox from its output shaft at a certain torque.
Additionally, the gearbox has two small pins that stop backdrive on the motor,
but they can easily be removed.

[[edit](/index.php?title=Drill_motor&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section:
Usage Notes" )]

## Usage Notes

  * Many [teams](/index.php/Team "Team" ) use the Drill motors on their [drive train](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train" ) because of its high power output, easy to use mounts, and accompanying gearbox that provides a large enough reduction. 
  * If the drill gearbox's torque limiter is used (not set to "drill"), robots may have jerky control, making it very difficult to drive. After a little practice, switching over to direct drive could be the solution. It risks burning out your motor if it [stalls](/index.php?title=Stalls&action=edit "Stalls" ), but makes it much easier to control.
