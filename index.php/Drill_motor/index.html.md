_This entry describes the drill motors included in the 2003 and 2004 [kit of parts](kit-of-parts ). Earlier drill motors had a smaller [shaft](/index.php?title=Shaft&action=edit "Shaft" ) and were not as powerful._

## _Drill (Skill Bosch) Motor_

Stall current: | 127 amps<br>
Stall torque: | 7.70 in-lb<br>
Max power: | 376 watts<br>
Free speed: | 19,670 rpm

Two drill motors and gearboxes were included with every [kit of parts](kit-of-parts). The drill motor, along with the [CIM motor](CIM_motor "CIM motor"), are the two most powerful motors included by a significant margin. One of the two basic [skid steer](skid-steer) [drive trains](drive-train) included in the [kit of parts](kit-of-parts) utilizes one drill motor on each side of the [robot](robot).

## Included gearbox

The drill motor is provided with the accompanying gearbox in the portable drill that the motor comes from. It is a [planetary gearbox](/index.php?title=Planetary_gearbox&action=edit "Planetary gearbox") with two [gears](/index.php?title=Gears&action=edit "Gears") with ratios of _ratio here_ and _here_. The gearbox has a torque limiting clutch that can be set to disengage the gearbox from its output shaft at a certain torque. Additionally, the gearbox has two small pins that stop backdrive on the motor, but they can easily be removed.

## Torque and Efficiency curves

### Without gearbox

### With gearbox set to low gear

## Usage Notes

- Many [teams](team) use the Drill motors on their [drive train](drive-train) because of its high power output, easy to use mounts, and accompanying gearbox that provides a large enough reduction.
- If the drill gearbox's torque limiter is used (not set to "drill"), robots may have jerky control, making it very difficult to drive. After a little practice, switching over to direct drive could be the solution. It risks burning out your motor if it [stalls](/index.php?title=Stalls&action=edit "Stalls"), but makes it much easier to control.
