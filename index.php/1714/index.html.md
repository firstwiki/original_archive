##  History

**More Robotics** was founded in 2005 with a goal to offer the FIRST experience to students who would not otherwise have the opportunity. We are a community team made up of students from many area schools. Our original sponsor was Thomas More High School, who welcomed our plans and saw them as a compliment to their Project Lead the Way Curriculum. We have grown a lot from those humble days and are we are having a blast.

### 2009 (Lunacy): Philbert 2

[1714 in 2009](/index.php/1714_in_2009 "1714 in 2009" )

1714's 2009 robot, named _Philbert 2_, was an attempt to maximize all of the
potential Lunacy strategies being thrown around. Designed to be a flexible
component of any alliance, Philbert 2 could shoot long range with a 180 degree
turret, camera track, make 10-ball short range dumps, and pin / covert the
empty cell while firing. Ultimately, long range shooting and camera tracking
was found to be ineffective, so the robot mostly played as a turreted dumper
that could play solid defense and the empty cell.

The robot was moderately successful at the Wisconsin regional, going 5 and 3
in qualifiers and serving as the first backup robot. Traction control and the
shooter's minimum distance were limiting factors in the robot's success, as
simple tasks like driving in a straight line were not trivial. After some
reflection and programming changes as well as the addition of a planetary
shooter transmission, the robot was ready for action at Minnesota 10,000
Lakes. With a much better 7-2 record and an average contribution of 35 points
per match, we were picked first overall by rookie team 2826 and won the event.
The robot managed a 5-2 record on Newton field, also serving as the first
backup robot.
