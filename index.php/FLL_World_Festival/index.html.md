### 2005 (No Limits Season)

This is the first year that this competition was called the **World
Festival**. Partly the name change was to reflect the international scope of
the event (20 countries were represented). Also, a registration fee was
required and this event was given more official status as a separate event on
the FIRST LEGO League website. See [FIRST LEGO League
website](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/default.aspx?pid=13390
