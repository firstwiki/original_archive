## Description

To attend the World Festival a team must be the Directors Award winner of their state (or region outside the United States). In 2005 (still part of the 2004 No Limits season), 74 teams representing most of the 50 states and 20 countries attended the event.

The event is held at the same time and location as the [FIRST Robotics Championship event](Championship_Event "Championship Event") (in 2004 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, GA). It is a 2 1/2 day event designed to celebrate the achievements of the Directors Award winners from around the world.

### 2005 (No Limits Season)

This is the first year that this competition was called the **World Festival**. Partly the name change was to reflect the international scope of the event (20 countries were represented). Also, a registration fee was required and this event was given more official status as a separate event on the FIRST LEGO League website.
