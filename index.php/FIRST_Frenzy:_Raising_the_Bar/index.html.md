## Field Layout

The field for the 2004 game was 48 feet by 24 feet in area and consisted of a
carpet bounded by walls, 7 feet in height, on the two sides where the drivers
and human player stood at their alliance stations, and a guardrail system on
the other sides. The guardrail was a horizontal pipe 20 inches high with
vertical supports. The walls consisted of a 3-foot diamond-plate base and a
4-foot transparent top.

In the center of the deck, at dead center and 12 inches off the ground, holds
the bar - made of steel pipe, it extends 10 feet upwards from the carpet. The
lower decks, one in front and one behind the upper deck (as seen by the
driver), were hexagons that each contained a stationary octagonal goal 28
inches in diameter made of PVC pipe which was 8 feet tall in the back and 6
feet tall in the front.

Two mobile goals, four feet in height, were also on the field, originally
found on either side of the center.

Galileo Field From Above

On the sides of the field midway between each alliance station, there were two
ball tee stations, each containing two tees with Bonus Balls on them. On the
top of each tee's frame was an infrared beacon that robots with infrared
sensors could detect. A line of white tape led from the robots' starting
position to the ball tees.

On top of each alliance station was a container with eighteen Small Balls in
it at the beginning of the match that would release the Small Balls onto the
field at the appropriate time.

In each corner of the playing field there was a two-foot-wide gap in the wall
separating the field from the alliance stations (known as the Ball Chute) so
that robots could pass Small Balls to the human players.

Each alliance stations contained areas for two teams. Each team area contained
a Ball Corral in front of their Ball Chute with two crossbars on the front and
sides. At the beginning of each match, three Small Balls were placed on the
front crossbar for each team.
