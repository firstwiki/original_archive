# Sub-team

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A sub-team is a unit within a [team](/index.php/Team "Team" ). Sub-teams have
a specific part of the task, whether it involves building the robot or not.

A list of common sub-teams:

  * [Mechanical Team](/index.php?title=Mechanical_Team&action=edit "Mechanical Team" ) \- Responsible for construction of robot (sometimes split into chassis and actuator) 
  * [Electrical Team](/index.php?title=Electrical_Team&action=edit "Electrical Team" ) \- Responsible for wiring of robot 
  * [Programming Team](/index.php?title=Programming_Team&action=edit "Programming Team" ) \- Responsible for programming the robot 
  * [Pneumatics Team](/index.php?title=Pneumatics_Team&action=edit "Pneumatics Team" ) \- Responsible for pneumatic part of robot 
  * [Business Team](/index.php?title=Business_Team&action=edit "Business Team" ) \- This will mean various things to various teams, but often the business team is involved in fundraising, shipping, seeking out mentorship and other extremely important tasks (see [NEMO](/index.php/NEMO "NEMO" )). 

Each team has its own set-up and therefore this list will be drastically
different from team to team and from year to year. However, this list has a
good part of the sub-teams that are shared by many teams.
