# Sub-team

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A sub-team is a unit within a [team](team). Sub-teams have a specific part of the task, whether it involves building the robot or not.

A list of common sub-teams:

- [Mechanical Team](/index.php?title=Mechanical_Team&action=edit "Mechanical Team") - Responsible for construction of robot (sometimes split into chassis and actuator)
- [Electrical Team](/index.php?title=Electrical_Team&action=edit "Electrical Team") - Responsible for wiring of robot
- [Programming Team](/index.php?title=Programming_Team&action=edit "Programming Team") - Responsible for programming the robot
- [Pneumatics Team](/index.php?title=Pneumatics_Team&action=edit "Pneumatics Team") - Responsible for pneumatic part of robot
- [Business Team](/index.php?title=Business_Team&action=edit "Business Team") - This will mean various things to various teams, but often the business team is involved in fundraising, shipping, seeking out mentorship and other extremely important tasks (see [NEMO](NEMO "NEMO")).

Each team has its own set-up and therefore this list will be drastically different from team to team and from year to year. However, this list has a good part of the sub-teams that are shared by many teams.
