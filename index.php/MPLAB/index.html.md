**MPLAB** is the name of the free Windows program that is used to edit, compile, and debug programs. The [software](Software "Software") comes with the [kit of parts](kit-of-parts) or with the [Robovation](robovation) kit. Programs are written in the [C programming language](PIC_C "PIC C") typically, but [assembly](Assembly "Assembly") can be put inline as well. MPLAB is the offical IDE (_integrated development environment_) offered by [Microchip](Microchip "Microchip"), but other editors can be used just the same. It is important, however, to compile the programs using the [Microchip C18](MCC18 "MCC18") compiler, which generates a [HEX file](/index.php?title=HEX_files&action=edit "HEX files"). This file can then be loaded onto the robot controller using [IFI loader](IFI_loader "IFI loader") or some similar program.
