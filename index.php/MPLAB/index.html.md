**MPLAB** is the name of the free Windows program that is used to edit, compile, and debug programs. The [software](/index.php/Software "Software" ) comes with the [kit of parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) or with the [Robovation](/index.php/Robovation "Robovation" ) kit. Programs are written in the [C programming language](/index.php/PIC_C "PIC C" ) typically, but [assembly](/index.php/Assembly "Assembly" ) can be put inline as well. MPLAB is the offical IDE (_integrated development environment_) offered by [Microchip](/index.php/Microchip "Microchip" ), but other editors can be used just the same. It is important, however, to compile the programs using the [Microchip C18](/index.php/MCC18 "MCC18" ) compiler, which generates a [HEX file](/index.php?title=HEX_files&action=edit "HEX files" ). This file can then be loaded onto the robot controller using [IFI loader](/index.php/IFI_loader "IFI loader" ) or some similar program.
