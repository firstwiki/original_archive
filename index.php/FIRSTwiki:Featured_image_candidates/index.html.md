### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

_Discussion on this feature is happening on the [Community
decisions](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Community_decisions "FIRSTwiki:Community
decisions" ) page._

Below are the images submitted to be _feature image._ If you have any
**objection** to them, **record your view** here and offer improvements for
change. The image are here so they receive your **attention** \-- fix them up,
give them that little edge they need to be consumed by the general masses.
Clear up FIRST-centric jargon that a new-comer might be unfamiliar with, add
'see also' links where appropriate, check grammar, etc.

To vote for an image, just move an image One Tier up (as in from Tier 1 to
Tier 2, etc.). To object to an image, move it one Tier down and provide
suggestions. The image with the highest tier will go up as the featured image.

You may also want to see the [FIRSTwiki:Featured
images](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Featured_images "FIRSTwiki:Featured images" )
page so you don't accidentally vote for an image that was already featured.
