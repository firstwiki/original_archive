Each year the [FIRST LEGO League](/index.php/FIRST_LEGO_League "FIRST LEGO
League" ) issues a challenge to the FLL community. This challenge is always of
scientific or topical interest and always around robotics, science and
technology.

The challenge will include of course the Robot Game challenging FLL teams to
create a robot out of [LEGO Mindstorms](/index.php/LEGO_Mindstorms "LEGO
Mindstorms" ) kits and other LEGO parts. It will also include a research
presentation or topic with formal presentation to the judges. Teams attend FLL
Events where they can compete with their peers and share what they've learned.
