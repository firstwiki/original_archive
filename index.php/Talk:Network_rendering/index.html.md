In the 3rd paragraph, he messed with Server, Manager, and Client. a lot. Can
someone who actually knows this please fix it? (I tried to correct it, But I
just don't know) --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303

    No, actually I think that it is right. There is no "client" program. The manager hands out the jobs, the servers receive, process, and send back the jobs, and the monitor (optional) is a UI to organize the jobs.--[Jbshaler](/index.php/User:Jbshaler "User:Jbshaler" ) 11:26, 4 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
     Edit: I guess you had already changed it to be correct.--[Jbshaler](/index.php/User:Jbshaler "User:Jbshaler" ) 11:04, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT)
