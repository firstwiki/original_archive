## History

Mindstorms Mayhem started in the fall of 2002 when Coach Streeter and Coach
Gray decided to teach a group of eight homeschoolers more about Legos, robots,
and programming. Our first season culminated at the New Hampshire State
Tournament where we won the 1st place robot performance with a perfect
392-point score.

In our second year we won the Director’s Award at the New Hampshire State
Tournament and were honored to represent New Hampshire at the April 2004
International Tournament in Atlanta. We had a great time! Imagine our
excitement when we won the Director’s Award at the FLL International
Invitational!

In the 2004-05 season five of our team members graduated, making room for five
new students. We enjoyed researching assistive technology available at
libraries. At the New Hampshire State Tournament, we won the Director’s Award
and counted it a privilege to represent New Hampshire again at the
international tournament in Atlanta! We had a great time in Atlanta and
finished the trip by winning First Place Robot Performance with 405 points,
the highest score possible, and Second Place Director's Award!

At the beginning of the Ocean Odyssey season, we were excited to hear that
nine out of our ten team members were returning. Our siblings formed a new
rookie team, More Mayhem, so we are an all-veteran team this year. On November
19, 2005, both teams qualified for the New Hampshire State Tournament!
Mindstorms Mayhem qualified with a First Place Robot Design Award and More
Mayhem qualified with a First Place Robot Performance as well as Third Place
Research Presentation award. Now both teams are preparing for the NH state
tournament on December 3, 2005.

(Note: 2006 (NanoQuest) History hasn't been written yet... Also for more
