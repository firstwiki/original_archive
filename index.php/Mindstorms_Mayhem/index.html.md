## History

Mindstorms Mayhem started in the fall of 2002 when Coach Streeter and Coach Gray decided to teach a group of eight homeschoolers more about Legos, robots, and programming. Our first season culminated at the New Hampshire State Tournament where we won the 1st place robot performance with a perfect 392-point score.

In our second year we won the Director's Award at the New Hampshire State Tournament and were honored to represent New Hampshire at the April 2004 International Tournament in Atlanta. We had a great time! Imagine our excitement when we won the Director's Award at the FLL International Invitational!

In the 2004-05 season five of our team members graduated, making room for five new students. We enjoyed researching assistive technology available at libraries. At the New Hampshire State Tournament, we won the Director's Award and counted it a privilege to represent New Hampshire again at the international tournament in Atlanta! We had a great time in Atlanta and finished the trip by winning First Place Robot Performance with 405 points, the highest score possible, and Second Place Director's Award!

At the beginning of the Ocean Odyssey season, we were excited to hear that nine out of our ten team members were returning. Our siblings formed a new rookie team, More Mayhem, so we are an all-veteran team this year. On November 19, 2005, both teams qualified for the New Hampshire State Tournament! Mindstorms Mayhem qualified with a First Place Robot Design Award and More Mayhem qualified with a First Place Robot Performance as well as Third Place Research Presentation award. Now both teams are preparing for the NH state tournament on December 3, 2005.
