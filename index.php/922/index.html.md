## History

Website: _<https://www.uetmrobotics.com>_

ULTIMATE (United Longhorn Team Inspiring Mental Attitude Towards Engineering)
was founded in 2002. The team has grown from 20 members in its heyday to 100+
today, but not only has the team grown in numbers, but in other aspects as
well. ULTIMATE concentrates on two things: promoting engineering and
technology and preparing its members for their future careers. Our team's
corporate style organization allows us to manage our large number of students
and achieve our team's objectives

projects" )]

## Team projects

ULTIMATE launched its FIRST Lego League team in Laredo, Texas in 2005. Three
years later we made history, holding the first robotics camp in south Texas.
The robotics camp has been held for 6 weeks each summer since 2008. During the
fall we are planning on spreading the word of FIRST even more and attempting
to start a Lego League team in every middle school.

  
Along with this project, the team has developed and executed a variety of
presentations for the community. One of our favorite projects is the
participation at the LCC Family Fun Fest at Laredo Community College. In
addition, the team performs community service while promoting awareness in
engineering, science, and technology.
