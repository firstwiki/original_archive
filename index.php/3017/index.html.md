## Overview

The Francis Lewis High School Robotics Team started as a club of a couple
members and grew to a FIRST team of 42 members. The team is divided amongst
the obligations required to compete and advertise. Each group has two
managers. We have mentors and advisors to help with the development of the
robot and the relationships of the students.
