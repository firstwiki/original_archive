### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The **Window motor** has been included in the FIRST kit of parts for many
years. Although it is a relatively small and less powerful motor (compared to
the CIM, Fisher Price, or Drill), it is still a very useful motor. With it's
built in worm-gearbox, higher resistance against backdrive, and moderate
reliability, many teams choose to use the window motors to power their robot's
mechanisms. There have been two types of window motors included in the FIRST
kit of parts: the [Denso window motor](Denso_window_motor "Denso
window motor" ) (Black) window motor and the [Jideco
motor](/index.php?title=Jideco_motor&action=edit "Jideco motor" )
(silver/unpainted) window motor. In 2005 one of each were included in the kit,
so you got two window motors overall.

## Included gearbox

The window motor's has a worm gear gearbox that is not backdrive-able.
However, inside the gearbox is a plastic gear which has been known to strip.

## Usage notes

  * **Only backdrive the motor so that the internal axle goes AWAY from the motor.** The other way will wreck it.
