Team 1337, from Germany, never competed. In hacker communities, the number
1337 has a very large signifigance due to its connection to the leet language.
Leet is a shorthand commonly used amongst hackers, and FIRST programmers are
notorious for being able to decipher the code into normal speak. Therefore, it
can be determined to be a shame that Team 1337 never had the opportunity to
grace the field of competition at a regional.
