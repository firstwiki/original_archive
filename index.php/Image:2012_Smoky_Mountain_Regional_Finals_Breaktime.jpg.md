From ChiefDelphi (<http://www.chiefdelphi.com/media/photos/37611>):

This is a Quick picture I took right before our Finals match (Finals 1 during
the Timeout ). Alliance Consisting of 772 Sabre Bytes, 234 Cyber Blue, and
3259 Thoroughbots. (Sorry our bot is blocking most of your bot 234) Great
ending match where teams 772, and 3259 finished a 2 robot balance about 10
seconds before the end of the match. 234 Unfortunately Died in the early parts
of the match. The two balanced Robots won the match for the Red Alliance
42-22. Great match-up against Teams 2386, 1319, 4264.

We (772) are currently Undefeated in 2012. We tied against 234 in match 50,
25-25. We Blew a fuse on our ball feeder system so we couldn't shoot any more.

This is the first time team 772 has finished first in qualifications, first
time finishing undefeated for the whole regional and first time winning a
regional!

Thanks for the great regional in Smoky Mountains, hoping to return next year
to defend our title. Great Job to all the other teams, you all did fantastic!
