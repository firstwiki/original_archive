## Team Info and History

tion=2 "Edit section: Team Location")]

### Team Location

We are based in St. Elmo, a neighborhood in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

### Team Age

We first registered on August 31st, 2007.

### Team Name

Teddy (our team captain), suggested the team name.<br>
"Tera" (not "Terra"), means trillion, and Teddy read in a Wired Magazine article that it was the current "hot number". The "storm" part came from "Mindstorms", and the "Team" part (it's actually part of the name) was used because Teddy didn't think "Terastorm" sounded good.

### How the team was started

Teddy read a newspaper article about FLL, and decided that he would create a team when he saw that the Chattanooga Engineers Club would sponsor any team in the Chattanooga area.

### Tullahoma Local

**Date Attended:** _November 3rd, 2007_

Wow! We got second place, and this was our first tournament!<br>
We got there at about 8:00am, central time. There were about 8 teams, and there were three rounds.

### Chattanooga Tournament

This was a small tournament, and it started at 9:00am (eastern time). There were four rounds, and no winners or losers. We did our project for the first time.

### Tennessee State Tournament

**Date Attended:** _December 1st, 2007_

Wow! This was a huge tournament, with 57 teams from all over the state and over 450 kids in it! We got no awards, but we did get the 13th overall score, and we got a call back for the Robot Design interview (there were seven teams that got a call back and six of them got an award).
