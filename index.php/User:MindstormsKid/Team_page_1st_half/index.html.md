## Team Info and History

tion=2 "Edit section: Team Location" )]

### Team Name

Teddy (our team captain), suggested the team name.  
"Tera" (not "Terra"), means trillion, and Teddy read in a Wired Magazine
article that it was the current "hot number". The "storm" part came from
"Mindstorms", and the "Team" part (it's actually part of the name) was used
because Teddy didn't think "Terastorm" sounded good.

### How the team was started

Teddy read a newspaper article about FLL, and decided that he would create a
team when he saw that the Chattanooga Engineers Club would sponsor any team in
the Chattanooga area.

### Tullahoma Local

Wow! We got second place, and this was our first tournament!  
We got there at about 8:00am, central time. There were about 8 teams, and
there were three rounds.

### Chattanooga Tournament

**Date Attended:** _November 17th, 2007_

This was a small tournament, and it started at 9:00am (eastern time). There
were four rounds, and no winners or losers. We did our project for the first

### Tennessee State Tournament

**Date Attended:** _December 1st, 2007_

Wow! This was a huge tournament, with 57 teams from all over the state and
over 450 kids in it! We got no awards, but we did get the 13th overall score,
and we got a call back for the Robot Design interview (there were seven teams
that got a call back and six of them got an award).
