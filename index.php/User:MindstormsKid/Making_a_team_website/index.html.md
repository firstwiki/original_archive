Well, I created this guide because all the other guides are the worst pages on
FIRSTwiki. One of them even looked like a vandal had written it all. Anyway, I
run my team's [website](http://teamterastorm.googlepages.com/
"http://teamterastorm.googlepages.com/" ), and (in my opinion), it's a good
one. Also note that I'm only 11 years old. The following guide is not neutral,
so that is why it's one of my subpages.

I will use Google in my guide, so if you don't want to have a Google Pages
website, then this guide is not for you.  
Also, this guide is _not_ for webmasters with lot of knowledge.

Now, let the website building begin!

## Getting a Website

section=2 "Edit section: Getting a Google account" )]

### Getting a Google account

  * Go [here](http://gmail.com/ "http://gmail.com/" ), and click "Sign up for Gmail". 
  * Stop! Don't enter any info yet! You need to enter the name fields: 

    

  * Now, stop and think. Does your team have two words, e.g. "Team Terastorm"? If so, put in your team name's first word in, e.g. "Team", as your first name, and you team name's second word as you last, e.g. "Terastorm". If your team name has one word, put in "Team" as you first name and your team name as the last name. If your team has more than two words, be creative. 
  * Now, enter the Login name. It should be something like "teamterastorm", "terastorm", or "felowshipofthebricks". In other words, you team name without any spaces or caps. 
  * Enter the rest of the fields. 
  * Click "I accept. Create my account." 
  * You're done!!

section=3 "Edit section: Getting to know what you have" )]

### Getting to know what you have

You now have the following stuff you can use:

  * Gmail, a email service. 
  * Google Page Creator, what you'll use to make the website. 
  * Picasa Web Albums. 
  * Google Groups, a mailing list and forum creator. 
  * Google Analytics, an analytics tool. 
  * Google Webmaster Tools. 
  * Google Maps. 
  * Google Docs. 
  * Google Custom Search, a custom search engine for your website. 
  * Google Calendar. 

But don't do anything with them yet!

### Getting your website

  * Go to <http://pages.google.com/> and sign in. 
  * I don't really remember what it's like when you get your fist website, but I think it just takes you to the Site Manager. 
  * If there are any pages there, delete them.

section=5 "Edit section: Configuring your website" )]

### Configuring your website

  * Click on the "Site Settings" link. 
  * Now, you need to make a hack, because there is currently a bug that makes it so you can't save your site settings: 

    

  * Make a new bookmark: 

    

  * The location (URL) should be: javascript:var TR_IsBrowserSupported=function(){};TR_initSettings(); 
  * Name it something like "Google Pages Settings Hack". 
  * For convenience, put it in your bookmarks toolbar (you don't have to, but it would make everything easier). 

  * Click on the bookmark. An alert should pop up at the top of the page. Don't worry about it. 
  * Now, change your site settings: 

    

  * Enter a title. This will be the first part of every page title on every page you make with the page creator. For my team's site, I put in "FLL Team #4857". That means when you go to the site's main page, which is named "Team Terastorm" in the page creator, it will display "FLL Team #4857 - Team Terastorm" on the titlebar and the tab that it's on. 
  * The site URL should be http://**yourteamname**.googlepages.com/. 
  * Don't worry about the homepage thing yet. 
  * Check the "Optimize the size of uploaded images" box. 
  * **Don't check any of the other boxes!**
  * Click the "Back to Site Manager" link. 
  * You're done! 

  * Now, make your first page. 

    

  * Click the "Create a new page..." link. 
  * **Stop!** You should make the page title your team name, as in "Team Terastorm". You can use any symbol you need when you create your page. This will be your homepage, so be sure to make it your team name! My team's site' main page is "Team Terastorm", just like I entered it, and the URL is "<http://teamterastorm.googlepages.com/teamterastorm>". 
  * Click the "Create and Edit" button.
