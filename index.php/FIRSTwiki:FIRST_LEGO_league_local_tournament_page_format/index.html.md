# FIRSTwiki:FIRST LEGO league local tournament page format

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

_This is an [FIRSTwiki Official Page Format](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats
"FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ). Please use it when appropriate._

Use this page format to create a page for a purely local tournament. This
would be the case where the tournament is not a recognized state or regional
tournament and the winners do not qualify to "move on" to another tournament.
These tournaments may be run very informally, offer only a limited set of
awards (or even none), and may be after the official season is over.

_You can insert this by placing {{subst:format/Flllocalevent}}, and saving._

We Suggest that you add [[Category:FLL Location Tournaments]] where Location
is your state (ex [[Category:FLL New York Tournaments]] if you were creating a
New York tournament.
