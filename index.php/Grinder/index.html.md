Common bench grinder

A **grinder** or **grinding machine** is a machine used for producing very
fine finishes or making very light cuts, using an abrasive wheel as the
cutting device. Depending on the grade of the grinding wheel it may be used
for sharpening cutting tools such as [lathe](/index.php/Lathe "Lathe" ) tools
or [drill](/index.php/Drill "Drill" ) bits. Alternatively it may be used to
roughly shape metal prior to [welding](/index.php/Welding "Welding" ) or
fitting.


##  Safety

  * Always wear [eye protection](/index.php/Eye_protection "Eye protection" )
  * NEVER allow loose clothing near the spinning abrasive wheels, as they are likely to be sucked in and injure the user 
  * Heavy duty gloves are recommended because the grinder produces lots of white-hot sparks and carbon scoring
