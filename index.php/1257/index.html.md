## History

Team 1257 was started by [Dr. Gail VanEkeren](Gail_VanEkeren "Gail
VanEkeren" ) at the Union County Magnet High School in September 2003. For the
[2004 season](1257_in_2004 "1257 in 2004" ), "Parallel Universe"
consisted of students from both the Union County Magnet High School and Union
County Vocational-Technical High School.


## Team projects

  * [Holonomic drive](/index.php?title=Holonomic_drive&action=edit "Holonomic drive" ) \- summer 2004, 1257 plans to construct a 4 wheeled holonomic drive robot using omniwheels. The software that will be used introduces some novel features and is largely completed. It will allow the robot to maintain an absolute orientation on the field so that forward on a joystick will always cause the robot to move in the same direction, regardless of which way it is facing. This ability may also allow a maneuver where the robot rotates about its center while moving forward. The robot will have 4 smaller omniwheels next to the drive omniwheel to track true movement relative to the ground for that particular drive train. Additionally, a custom circuit utilizing a counter and a shift register will be constructed for each drive system so that counting can be (mostly) offloaded from the [FRC](Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ). 
  * A "charity box" inspired by one seen at the local Dairy Queen, potentially in partnership with the Dairy Queen. It will be a garbage can-sized robot-looking wheeled thing. Inside its clear "chest" will be various plinko machine type things to bounce the donated coins around.
