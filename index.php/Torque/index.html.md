## Rigourous Definition

Torque is the cross-product of the [radius](/index.php?title=Radius&action=edit "Radius") and [force](/index.php?title=Force&action=edit "Force") [vectors](/index.php?title=Vector&action=edit "Vector") (![\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times
\\mathbf{F}](/media/math/b/a/2/ba2e57363e6ce199c675ba591f0283fe.png)), in that order. If the torque exerted by a [motor](Motor "Motor") on its axle is known, one can find the force exerted at a different distance from the center.

## Conceptual Definition

Here is another way to think about torque. Imagine a bar that is two feet long is connected to the shaft of your drive train, and a constant force of 20 pounds is applied. This is equivalent to 40 'foot-pounds' of torque (2_20). As power is (torque_ angular velocity) and the power of a motor is constant, tradeoffs have to be made between torque and speed. Torque is necessary for pushing and climbing, and speed is necessary for, well, speed. A carefully designed [transmission](Transmission "Transmission") lets you get the best of both worlds, allowing you to switch between torque and speed (within the limitations of the motor of course.)
