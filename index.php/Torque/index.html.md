##  Rigourous Definition

Torque is the cross-product of the
[radius](/index.php?title=Radius&action=edit "Radius" ) and
[force](/index.php?title=Force&action=edit "Force" )
[vectors](/index.php?title=Vector&action=edit "Vector" )
(![\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times
\\mathbf{F}](/media/math/b/a/2/ba2e57363e6ce199c675ba591f0283fe.png)), in that
order. If the torque exerted by a [motor](Motor "Motor" ) on its
axle is known, one can find the force exerted at a different distance from the
center.


##  Conceptual Definition

Here is another way to think about torque. Imagine a bar that is two feet long
is connected to the shaft of your drive train, and a constant force of 20
pounds is applied. This is equivalent to 40 'foot-pounds' of torque (2*20). As
power is (torque * angular velocity) and the power of a motor is constant,
tradeoffs have to be made between torque and speed. Torque is necessary for
pushing and climbing, and speed is necessary for, well, speed. A carefully
designed [transmission](Transmission "Transmission" ) lets you get
the best of both worlds, allowing you to switch between torque and speed
(within the limitations of the motor of course.)
