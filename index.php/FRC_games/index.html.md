Each year in early January, FIRST releases the design of the current year's
game. Thus begins what is affectionately known as the [build
season](/index.php/Build_season "Build season" ). When the game is revealed,
the six week countdown starts. Each year the game is structurally different
from previous years in remarkable ways. FIRST strives to present a visually
stimulating game for spectators, a game interesting for the participants,
challenging for [veteran teams](/index.php/Veteran_teams "Veteran teams" ),
yet accessible to [rookie teams](/index.php/Rookie_teams "Rookie teams" ).
This is never an easy balance to reach, but FIRST is known for suprising
innovations; features such as [autonomous mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode
"Autonomous mode" ), the bins of [Stack Attack](/index.php/Stack_Attack "Stack
Attack" ), and the stairs in [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the
Bar](/index.php/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"
) show just how clever FIRST can be.
