Each year in early January, FIRST releases the design of the current year's game. Thus begins what is affectionately known as the [build season](Build_season "Build season"). When the game is revealed, the six week countdown starts. Each year the game is structurally different from previous years in remarkable ways. FIRST strives to present a visually stimulating game for spectators, a game interesting for the participants, challenging for [veteran teams](Veteran_teams "Veteran teams"), yet accessible to [rookie teams](Rookie_teams "Rookie teams"). This is never an easy balance to reach, but FIRST is known for suprising innovations; features such as [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode"), the bins of [Stack Attack](Stack_Attack "Stack
Attack"), and the stairs in [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar](FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar") show just how clever FIRST can be.
