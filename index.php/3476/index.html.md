## History

Team Code Orange was founded in April 2010 by a determined adult team leader and an enthusiastic group of kids interested in engineering.

Although it has remained a small team in the short one and a half years of its existence, Code Orange's accomplishments have expanded at a tremendous rate.

3476's rookie year was kicked off by a pre-season intensive build in which the team constructed a simple moving robot. During the 2011 season, Logomotion, the rookie team took a drastic step and built a robot that could participate fully in all aspects of the game, featuring both a lifting elevator and a working minibot. At the team's first competition, the San Diego Regional, in 2011, the team was plagued by continual mechanical issues with their claw system. However, the judges recognized the team's unique dynamics and awarded them the Judge's award.

In the 2012 season, Rebound Rumble, Code Orange moved even further, combining a quick, agile drive train with an effective bridge manipulator and a potent ball-acquiring and shooting mechanism. In the San Diego regional, Code Orange won the Engineering Excellence award for their innovative robot design. On Sunday, Code Orange was the #1 pick by the #1 seed, rookie team 4161\. The first-year and second-year duo soon joined third-year team 3255, to formulate the championship alliance that went undefeated in the elimination matches.

## Robots

2010 Pre-Season Project

season_robot.jpg)](Image:3476_2011_pre-season_robot.jpg "Image
:3476_2011_pre-season_robot.jpg")

This robot was the first robot ever built by Code Orange. It featured four omni wheels arranged at 45 degree angles on a square frame. It was an invaluable lesson for the season to come.

2011 Logomotion Robot

ge:3476_2011_robot.jpg "Image:3476_2011_robot.jpg")

Code Orange's first game robot utilized four omni wheels in its drive train, each with a dedicated CIM motor. It utilized two window motors to lift a two- stage elevator system that could reach all but the top middle peg on the rack. A grabber system using two servo motors folded down autonomously at the beginning of the match. The rear of the robot featured a powerful minibot- deployment shelf powered by surgical tubing. The minibot was driven by two Tetrix motors and two large wheels.

Although the drivetrain was somewhat difficult to control, the elevator slow, and the grabber a effective lesson on the proper application of servo motors, the team learned a lot from its rookie year and was proud to receive the Judge's Award at their only regional.

2011 Summer Project

season_robot.jpg)](Image:3476_2012_pre-season_robot.jpg "Image
:3476_2012_pre-season_robot.jpg")

In order to supplement its ever-growing effort of outreach into the community, Code Orange decided to construct a t-shirt shooting robot. The robot utilized a kitbot frame and a simple air-powered cannon with on-board compressor. The resulting robot please many children and adults alike in Code Orange's several outreach events.

2012 Rebound Rumble Robot

ge:3476_2012_robot.jpg "Image:3476_2012_robot.jpg")

The 2012 build season was a revolutionary experience for members of 3476\. The team utilized CAD, detailed drawings and machined parts for the first time. The resulting robot, "Pipeline," not only won the Engineering Excellence award at the San Diego regional, but also was on the championship alliance in the same event.

The robot used 4 CIM motors driving six pneumatic wheels. The shooting flywheel was propelled by two BaneBot motors through CIMulator gearboxes. Both the ball lifter mechanism, utilizing four loops of solid polycord, and the ball intake, had a dedicated BaneBot motor and CIMulator gearbox. The bridge control utilized a fold-down wedge that guided the bridge down and beneath the robot's bumpers. It was actuated by two linkages that were powered by a window motor and locked into a horizontal position.
