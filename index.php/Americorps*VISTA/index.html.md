_Summary copied from [FIRST Web Site](http://www.usfirst.org/community/volunteers/content.aspx?id=3312 "http://www.usfirst.org/community/volunteers/content.aspx?id=3312"):_<br>
The AmeriCorps* VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program provides full-time members to nonprofit, faith-based, and other community organizations and public agencies to create and expand programs that seek to bring low- income individuals and communities out of poverty. VISTA Members spend a one- year commitment addressing those needs of low-income communities by supporting projects that focus on building permanent infrastructure in nonprofit organizations. This program is made possible through a grant from the Corporation for National & Community Service.

FIRST AmeriCorps* VISTA members assist in the recruitment and support of Teams, Team Mentors, and Volunteers within their underserved community for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), the FIRST LEGO League (FLL), the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) programs, and other initiatives in the geographic area in which they reside. VISTA assistance may include training, locating funding, and developing resources to sustain team organizations.

VISTA members report to the Volunteer Resources Manager at FIRST and work with direction from the FIRST Regional Directors in their specific area, and collaboratively with FIRST Senior Mentors, Regional Planning and Volunteer committees, program partners, and teams.

FIRST VISTA members strengthen and expand FIRST's partnerships with businesses, educational institutions, and communities, helping FIRST move closer to achieving its goal--to change society by providing youth with experiences that give them not just the skills but also the desire to solve problems through scientific and technological innovation.

FIRST AmerCorps* VISTA Program areas include:

Connecticut District of Columbia Delaware Massachusetts Maryland Maine New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont<br>
