Welcome Mayhem!

I made a slight edit to your page (New Hampshire instead of New Hampshire, USA)

If you go to the home page and click FLL Teams by Location you'll see that you will now be able to navigate to your page that way.

Also, by all means check out the tutorial on how to add your logo to the right of your team page [here](FIRSTwiki:Add_your_team_logo_tutorial_%28FLL%29 "FIRSTwiki:Add your team logo tutorial \(FLL\)"). - [PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll") 19:59, 6 April 2006 (EDT)
