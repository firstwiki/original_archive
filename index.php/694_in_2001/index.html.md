## Robot

The lightest Stuy robot to date, Stuyle came in around the 80s. Short and sweet, she was the first of Stuy's robots to move under the now-classic four- wheel tank drive design. Armed with two flipper arms that captured the goals and pulled **up** on them, she was one of the few at the NYC regional able to balance both goals on the bridge (and she was sucessful at such in a match too). Stuyle (along with he wonderful operators) managed to pull Stuyvesant through to a silver-medal win in our rookie year.
