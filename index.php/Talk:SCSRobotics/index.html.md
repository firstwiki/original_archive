Welcome SCSRobotics!

And see you in Atlanta!

I made a minor correction to your page to make it match with the location
scheme. Since you were the first Canada team on the WIKI I realized that I had
to create the location pages for the Canadian provinces so if you start from
the home page and click on FLL Teams by Location you'll see they are all there
and clicking on Ontario will display your team name.

    Couple of other things. **Can you check out [FLL Teams by Location](/index.php/FLL_Teams_by_Location "FLL Teams by Location" ) page to see if I've represented the Canadian provinces properly?** Also, by all means create a FIRSTWiki username for yourself. Makes it easier to track you edits and other things. -[PeterFll](/index.php/User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll" ) 19:56, 6 April 2006 (EDT)
