The **Indiana Robotics Invitational** is an off-season FIRST competition held
in Indianapolis, Indiana. Hosted by three teams, it is today the largest of
all off-season competitions and even has more teams competing than any
seasonal regional competition. The competition is highly competitive to gain
entrance, and each team's application is thoroughly examined. All Indiana
teams are immediately accepted, but teams outside the state must qualify. The
three host teams are Cyber Blue: Team 234, The TechnoKats: Team 45, and The
Kil-o-Bytes: Team 1024. The event was first started by the TechnoKats, but its
rapid growth caused need for a second sponsor, Cyber Blue. The Kil-o-Bytes are
the site host; the competition is held at Lawrence North High School.

As the most prestigious off-season event, it is commonly referred to as the
"FRC All-Star" tournament.
