# Talk:Drivetrain

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Someone should add a description of each drivetrain. Some of them do this
fine, like car drive, but some don't give anything at all and its not really
my area of expertise to give info on. Plus it is something more to give than
just pro/cons of each drivetrain. [Tanner](/index.php/User:TannerLD

##  Tank Drive

Nothing on Tank Drive? I would have expected it to be considered one of the
more common drive systems along with 4WD. I'm suprised to see theres nothing
on it here. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 14:39, 1
