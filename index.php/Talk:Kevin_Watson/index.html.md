Good to have you here Mr. Watson! If I remember correctly you wrote the
default code used this year and demo code. Thanks! I hope you'll be able to
contribute your first-hand knowledge of the default code to the
[Programming](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ) section.

I tagged this with a POV because of the criticisms section. I don't know if it
should be removed, but it's certainly a bit accusatory.
