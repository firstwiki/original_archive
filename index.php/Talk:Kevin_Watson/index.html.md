Good to have you here Mr. Watson! If I remember correctly you wrote the default code used this year and demo code. Thanks! I hope you'll be able to contribute your first-hand knowledge of the default code to the [Programming](Programming "Programming") section. --[Phrontist](User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist") 22:05, 14 Jul 2004 (EDT)
