**Engineering** is the application of scientific and technical knowledge to solve human problems. [Engineers](Engineer "Engineer") use imagination, judgment and reasoning to apply science, technology, mathematics, and practical experience. The result is the design, production, and operation of useful objects or processes.

## Disciplines

- [Electrical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "wikipedia:Electrical_engineering") refers to the use knowledge of electromagnetics and often [programming](programming) to develop electrical components for electrical machines, computers, computer chips and power systems. An offshoot of electrical engineering is [computer engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "wikipedia:Computer_engineering"), which focuses on the design and development of computing systems.
- [Mechanical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "wikipedia:Mechanical_engineering") is the use of physical sciences to design and develop mechanical devices that covers a broad spectrum of offshoot disciplines, including:

  [Aerospace/aeronautical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_eningeering "wikipedia:Aerospace_eningeering") [Astronautical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautical_engineering "wikipedia:Astronautical_engineering") [Automotive engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering "wikipedia:Automotive_engineering")

- [Civil engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "wikipedia:Civil_engineering") is the discipline used to design structures such as buildings, bridges, tunnels, highways, etc. A common joke is that "mechanical engineers build weapons and civil engineers build targets."

- [Industrial engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "wikipedia:Industrial_engineering") (and [enterprise systems engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "wikipedia:Systems_engineering")) is the application of business and problem-solving models to engineering environments. Industrial engineers use their background in math, science, and business to maximize efficiency and production.
- [Biomedical engineering and bioengineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering "wikipedia:Biomedical_engineering") is the application of engineering to medical and biological problems such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, image processing, physiological signal processing, biomechanics, biomaterials, systems analysis, and 3-D modeling. Biomedical engineers have a strong background in biology and medicinal science.
- [Chemical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "wikipedia:Chemical_engineering") is the use of chemistry to develop chemical products and solutions. A major offshoot is [materials science and engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "wikipedia:Materials_science").
- [Agricultural engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_engineering "wikipedia:Agricultural_engineering")
- [Environmental engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_engineering "wikipedia:Environmental_engineering")
- [Fire protection engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_protection_engineering "wikipedia:Fire_protection_engineering")
- [Geotechnical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_engineering "wikipedia:Geotechnical_engineering")
- [Mining engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_engineering "wikipedia:Mining_engineering")
- [Nuclear engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "wikipedia:Nuclear_engineering")
- [Petroleum engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_engineering "wikipedia:Petroleum_engineering")
- [Traffic engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_engineering "wikipedia:Traffic_engineering")
