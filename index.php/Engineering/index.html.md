**Engineering** is the application of scientific and technical knowledge to solve human problems. [Engineers](/index.php/Engineer "Engineer" ) use imagination, judgment and reasoning to apply science, technology, mathematics, and practical experience. The result is the design, production, and operation of useful objects or processes.

Disciplines" )]

##  Disciplines

  * [Electrical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "wikipedia:Electrical_engineering" ) refers to the use knowledge of electromagnetics and often [programming](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ) to develop electrical components for electrical machines, computers, computer chips and power systems. An offshoot of electrical engineering is [computer engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "wikipedia:Computer_engineering" ), which focuses on the design and development of computing systems. 
  * [Mechanical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering "wikipedia:Mechanical_engineering" ) is the use of physical sciences to design and develop mechanical devices that covers a broad spectrum of offshoot disciplines, including: 

     [Aerospace/aeronautical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_eningeering "wikipedia:Aerospace_eningeering" )
     [Astronautical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronautical_engineering "wikipedia:Astronautical_engineering" )
     [Automotive engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering "wikipedia:Automotive_engineering" )

  * [Civil engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering "wikipedia:Civil_engineering" ) is the discipline used to design structures such as buildings, bridges, tunnels, highways, etc. A common joke is that "mechanical engineers build weapons and civil engineers build targets." 
  * [Industrial engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_engineering "wikipedia:Industrial_engineering" ) (and [enterprise systems engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering "wikipedia:Systems_engineering" )) is the application of business and problem-solving models to engineering environments. Industrial engineers use their background in math, science, and business to maximize efficiency and production. 
  * [Biomedical engineering and bioengineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering "wikipedia:Biomedical_engineering" ) is the application of engineering to medical and biological problems such as bioinformatics, medical imaging, image processing, physiological signal processing, biomechanics, biomaterials, systems analysis, and 3-D modeling. Biomedical engineers have a strong background in biology and medicinal science. 
  * [Chemical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "wikipedia:Chemical_engineering" ) is the use of chemistry to develop chemical products and solutions. A major offshoot is [materials science and engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science "wikipedia:Materials_science" ). 
  * [Agricultural engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_engineering "wikipedia:Agricultural_engineering" )
  * [Environmental engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_engineering "wikipedia:Environmental_engineering" )
  * [Fire protection engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_protection_engineering "wikipedia:Fire_protection_engineering" )
  * [Geotechnical engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotechnical_engineering "wikipedia:Geotechnical_engineering" )
  * [Mining engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_engineering "wikipedia:Mining_engineering" )
  * [Nuclear engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_engineering "wikipedia:Nuclear_engineering" )
  * [Petroleum engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_engineering "wikipedia:Petroleum_engineering" )
  * [Traffic engineering](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_engineering "wikipedia:Traffic_engineering" )
