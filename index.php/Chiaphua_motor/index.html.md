One of the two basic [skid steer](Skid_steer "Skid steer") [drive trains](Drive_train "Drive train") included in the [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts") is designed to utilize one or two CIM motors on each side of the [robot](Robot "Robot"). This exact motor has been known over the years as the "[CIM](http://en.wikipedia.or
g/wiki/Chiaphua_Components_Group#Business_Segments "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaphua_Components_Group#Business_Segments")", "[Chiaphua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaphua_Components_Group "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaphua_Components_Group")", or "Atwood" motor. The motor is provided in the kit of parts as part number "FR801-001". Some years have also shipped a larger three inch "Mini-bike" motor (part number FP801-005).

Exact specifications are available from FIRST: [FR801-001 MOTOR SPECIFICATIONS](http://www2.usfirst.org/2005comp/Specs/CIM.pdf "http://www2.usfirst.org/2005comp/Specs/CIM.pdf")

## By year

### 2012

Two standard 2.5" motors (PN:AM802-001A) included, with AndyMark CIMple Box assembly. [[1]](http://www.usfirst.org/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Robot

### 2010

Two standard 2.5" motors included in the kit with the Andy Mark Toughbox gearb oxes.[[3]](http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/Community/FRC/Game_and_Season_

### 2009

Two standard 2.5" motors included in the kit with the Andy Mark Toughbox gearb oxes.[[5]](http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/2009%20KOP%20Checklist%20Rev%2
0B.pdf "http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedFiles/2009%20KOP%20Checklist%20Rev%20B.pdf") Up to four were allowed, but due to the fact that the wheels and floor this year limited the available traction, it was impractical for teams to use more than 2 in their drivetrains. Some teams used their additional CIMs to power propellers and ducted fans to gain more control on the slippery surface.

### 2008

Two standard motors are included, 3.5" CIM no longer allowed.

### 2007

Two of the standard 2.5" motors are included, and a larger 3.5" CIM.

### 2006

Two of the four CIM motors were replaced with the larger "mini-bike" motors. [[7]](http://www2.usfirst.org/2006comp/Manual/5-The_Robot_Rev_F.pdf "http://www2.usfirst.org/2006comp/Manual/5-The_Robot_Rev_F.pdf")

### 2005

Four of the motors were included in the KOP.

### 2004

Two of the motors are included in the KOP.

## Usage Notes

- Partially because of the CIM's relatively large size and consequentially low power density, the motor can withstand longer periods at, or near, stall. CIMs do not burn out nearly as often as [drill motors](Drill_motor "Drill motor") or [fisher price motors](Fisher_price_motor "Fisher price motor").
- Because the CIM is not designed for a specific application like the (obsolete) [drill motor](Drill_motor "Drill motor"), it has little or no [wiring bias](Wiring_bias "Wiring bias"). This means the motor is equally powerful in forward in reverse. This can be useful in many applications. For example, drive trains which involve a pair of motors running in opposite directions can suffer from driving in a large radius circle when both motors are set to equal speeds. The CIM is relatively immune from such problems in that situation. _**Motors:**_<br>
