## History

The Delphi E.L.I.T.E. Robotics team originated in Warren, Ohio in 1998 when
Delphi approached the Warren City School's Board of Education. This was a
natural connection for two of the board members because one of them worked in
the promotions department for Delphi, and the other's husband worked for
Delphi. It also seemed to be a great match because Delphi is Warren's largest
employer.

The administrators from both Warren G. Harding High School and Delphi, along
with four teachers and a few engineers loved the idea of a program where
technology would play a central part in the curriculum. So, the Delphi team
was born. Its purpose is to Encourage Learning in Technology and Engineering
(E.L.I.T.E.).

This program has had a major impact on Warren G. Harding High School as well
as the entire community of Warren, Ohio. Every year, anywhere from 15 to 75
members design and build a robot that completes the objectives of the
designated competition. It is during this time and through this program that
students are taught exactly what the purpose of FIRST is; to inspire students
to explore the fields of science and technology. This program is teaching
students to work together as a team, to learn how to deal with people in
varying and yet practical situations, to practice gracious professionalism,
and to exercise the qualities of leadership.

The Delphi E.L.I.T.E. team is not just fun and games, however. Team 48 plays
an active role in performing community service work. Habitat for Humanity and
Adopt a Highway are just two of the many programs that directly benefit the
city of Warren, its people, and its appearance.
