"A logo for this wiki - This wiki needs a logo! One of our mentor's (see
below: Mr.Ballou) teaches a computer graphics class, and he will be making the
logo an assingment for his students. We can pick from one of those, or any
other submissions. " Wow! I assume this was a result of what [Phrontist was

thread](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=266280&postcount=2
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=266280&postcount=2" ).
