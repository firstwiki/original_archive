History" )]

## History

Central SpaceLab first competed in the pilot event at the Indianapolis
Children's Museum in 1998. Since then, they have competed in every
competition. Central SpaceLab went to Nationals in Atlanta for Mission Mars,
No Limits, and Ocean Odyssey after placing first in the state competitions in
those years.

Robots" )]

## Robots

All of Central SpaceLab's robots are built for modularity, with a versatile
drive base that can use additional attachments and arms. They have used the
same robot for Ocean Odyssey as No Limits, which in turn was very similar to
the Mission Mars robot.

Programming" )]

## Programming

Central SpaceLab keeps confidential programming secrets that are passed down
each year and used in competitions. These trade secrets, for example, allow
them to surpass the three sensor limit and incorporate additional sensors, as
well as allowing them to use more than five different programs.
