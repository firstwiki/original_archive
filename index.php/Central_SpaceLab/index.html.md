## History

Central SpaceLab first competed in the pilot event at the Indianapolis Children's Museum in 1998\. Since then, they have competed in every competition. Central SpaceLab went to Nationals in Atlanta for Mission Mars, No Limits, and Ocean Odyssey after placing first in the state competitions in those years.

## Robots

All of Central SpaceLab's robots are built for modularity, with a versatile drive base that can use additional attachments and arms. They have used the same robot for Ocean Odyssey as No Limits, which in turn was very similar to the Mission Mars robot.

## Programming

Central SpaceLab keeps confidential programming secrets that are passed down each year and used in competitions. These trade secrets, for example, allow them to surpass the three sensor limit and incorporate additional sensors, as well as allowing them to use more than five different programs.
