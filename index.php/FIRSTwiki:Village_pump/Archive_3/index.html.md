## Uploading FIRST manuals

Obviously the FIRST manuals are copyrighted and can't be uploaded under the
terms of the GFDL. It's also unlikely that someone could contact FIRST and get
permission to upload them under the GFDL. It would be really good to have the
manuals availble after FIRST takes them down. Should one of the sysops contact
FIRST to allow us to upload the manuals (without licensing them), should we
just upload them? Should the manuals not be uploaded?

    interesting idea. I agree. But they should be converted to Wikitax from PDF (A long process, no doubt). I actually did a fairly good job of getting the manuals that were on their website at some point. Should they be called _game name_/_file name_? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 23:52, 25 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I'm not sure if it is of any use to wikify the manuals ever, but certainly not when there is so much more content that needs to be written. That's why I suggested just uploading the pdfs. That way there is an archive of them, and they can be refered to by the game page. I have the important parts of the 2002 and 1999 manuals. --[Sciencewhiz](User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz" ) 11:05, 26 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I ment Wikitax, not content. And MediaWiki doesn't support linking into PDFs, or searching them. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 13:45, 26 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    

    It supports whatever I make it support, Astronouth :) Check recent changes. As for searching, That isn't crucial, there is still great value in archiving these materials. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 18:28, 26 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    Should forms be included? And is there a mass-upload option? And should seperate revisions be included? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 01:32, 27 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    I've got the basic stuff from 1999 to 2004 (except 2001) ready to upload. Say when. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 01:51, 27 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    How big are they total and how many files? There is no mass upload feature, sorry. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 12:50, 27 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    20 files, all PDF, totaling 4.21 MB. It's basically what I thought was the manual (no appendecies). I can zip everything up (or just portions) and e-mail it to any one who wants them. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 00:37, 28 Jul 2004 (EDT)

##  FIRSTwiki Team Contact-A-Thon

**Discussion moved to [FIRSTwiki talk:Contact-A-Thon](FIRSTwiki_talk:Contact-A-Thon "FIRSTwiki talk:Contact-A-Thon" )** \--[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 18:06, 14 Jul 2004 (EDT) 


## Potential name changes

**Changes enacted.** \--[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 21:21, 15 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

  
_taken from [talk:FIRT LEGO League
Teams](/index.php?title=Talk:FIRT_LEGO_League_Teams&action=edit "Talk:FIRT
LEGO League Teams" )_

    I was thinking maybe all FLL articles should be deprecated in terms of naming conventions so [team](Team "Team" ) points to the FRC page with a note about the FLL page somewhere on it. And [team (FLL)](Team_%28FLL%29 "Team \(FLL\)" ) points to the FLL page. FIRSTwiki is primarily FRC related now, and I imagine it will always be much more FRC specific. I know, NPOV and such, but see my comment [Talk:Designing a team webpage](Talk:Designing_a_team_webpage "Talk:Designing a team webpage" ) \--[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I would (and do) agree with that. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 15:43, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Because this is a slightly big issue, can someone else chime on in this before we make the changes? --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    Ambiguous acronyms like FLL and FRC drive me nuts. I change them whenever I see them. It's lazy writing. -- [Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )

    

    Maddie, I dislike ambiguous nomenclature too, but you can't apply a rule like no acronyms because its context that matters. I think it is far more likely that someone would recognize a link on FIRSTwiki to FLL as FIRST LEGO League than recognizing a link to [organizations](Organizations "Organizations" ) as being a link to a page about unofficial non-team organizations that are FIRST-related. The main reason I use FLL in my propsed name scheme is because [Team (FIRST LEGO League)](/index.php?title=Team_%28FIRST_LEGO_League%29&action=edit "Team \(FIRST LEGO League\)" ) is kinda ugly and long. Please make a suggestion for another naming convention if you have one. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:06, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

  

I decided this is important enough to actually go on the proper discussion
page. Here is the list of proposed name changes:

  1. [FIRST Robotics Team](FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics Team" ) -> [Team](Team "Team" )
  2. [FIRST LEGO League Team](FIRST_LEGO_League_Team "FIRST LEGO League Team" ) -> [Team (FLL)](Team_%28FLL%29 "Team \(FLL\)" )
  3. [Index of FRC teams](Index_of_FRC_teams "Index of FRC teams" ) -> [Index of teams](Index_of_teams "Index of teams" )
  4. [Index of FRC teams by region](Index_of_FRC_teams_by_region "Index of FRC teams by region" ) -> [Index of teams by region](Index_of_teams_by_region "Index of teams by region" )
  5. [Index of FRC teams by age](Index_of_FRC_teams_by_age "Index of FRC teams by age" ) -> [Index of teams by age](Index_of_teams_by_age "Index of teams by age" )
  6. [FRC Games](FRC_Games "FRC Games" ) -> [Game](Game "Game" ) (note: also changed to singular because I think article should say more about the fact that FIRST is focused on a "game" each year, not the fact that there have been many games) 

For all not yet created FLL pages, the naming scheme should be "&lt;FRC
name&gt; (FLL)", like [Team (FLL)](Team_%28FLL%29 "Team \(FLL\)" ).
There will obviously be hundreds of links to the redirect now but I don't
think its really neccesary to have a big name changing campaign or write a bot
or anything, just change them as you come across them.
