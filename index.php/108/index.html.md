## The Team

108 started in 1995, at Dillard High School. After a few years, J.P. Taravella
High School joined the team. One of the original 108 members has seen the
entire transformation of the team. His name was Mike Sansone; he was a student
at Dillard High, was one of the original SOAP people, got an internship at
Motorola, and has mentored the team since. We hope that there will be more
members from the team that will have a similar progression, but who knows!
SOAP stands for SigmaC@T Opponant Analysis Program; it is a program designed
to scout other teams to check compatability. SOAP is available to all other
teams, if they would like to use it. Check out the website for more info!

## Team projects

### SOAP

SOAP or SigmaC@T Opponent Analysis Program is a team initiative geared at
providing data, video, and tools to aid other teams in their scouting
endeavors. SOAP has changed over the years as the team has gone through
several transformations internally, but still continues to provide a quality
service for the FRC community.

Started in 1996, the program was created to primarily help teams that did not
have the resources to scout and strategize effectively. Match videos and basic
scoring data were made publicly available on the website.

In 2001, the program had grown so large, that SOAP had to look for outside
assistance. Other teams volunteered their time and members to help in
archiving events 108 did not attend. The team even shipped out hardware to
those that wanted to help, but were lacking the resources necessary to get the
job done. To this day, we continue to ship said hardware out to those who want
to help.

Through 2005, SOAP had the largest match video archive in all of FIRST. The
popularity of the program led the students to explore other avenues of content
delivery. Because uploading matches during the competition was a slow process,
SOAP began to burn free CD's for all teams that were at any event 108
attended. Teams loved the idea, but the cost and effort it took eventually led
to the cancellation of the CD distribution program after the 2006 season.

As similar initiatives sprouted and student availability diminished in the mid
2000's, SOAP was forced to rethink their approach. Sites like The Blue
Alliance were able to accomplish what SOAP has done all of these years while
adding some much needed functionality, pushing the bar further. In 2008, an
alumnus of 108 and former SOAP lead came to the rescue with a FRC live event
portal named SOAP Gameday. Gameday's basic top level experience combines
webcasts, live event data (scores, rankings, etc), and a chat together in one
easy-to-use web interface, all in real-time. This simplifies the steps needed
to track the events as they happen and immerses you in the data, providing an
experience never really accomplished before 2008. Since 2008, a new an
improved version of Gameday has been introduced each season. A new version has
been announced for 2010.
