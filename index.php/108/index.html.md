## The Team

108 started in 1995, at Dillard High School. After a few years, J.P. Taravella High School joined the team. One of the original 108 members has seen the entire transformation of the team. His name was Mike Sansone; he was a student at Dillard High, was one of the original SOAP people, got an internship at Motorola, and has mentored the team since. We hope that there will be more members from the team that will have a similar progression, but who knows! SOAP stands for SigmaC@T Opponant Analysis Program; it is a program designed to scout other teams to check compatability. SOAP is available to all other teams, if they would like to use it. Check out the website for more info!

## Team projects

### SOAP

SOAP or SigmaC@T Opponent Analysis Program is a team initiative geared at providing data, video, and tools to aid other teams in their scouting endeavors. SOAP has changed over the years as the team has gone through several transformations internally, but still continues to provide a quality service for the FRC community.

Started in 1996, the program was created to primarily help teams that did not have the resources to scout and strategize effectively. Match videos and basic scoring data were made publicly available on the website.

In 2001, the program had grown so large, that SOAP had to look for outside assistance. Other teams volunteered their time and members to help in archiving events 108 did not attend. The team even shipped out hardware to those that wanted to help, but were lacking the resources necessary to get the job done. To this day, we continue to ship said hardware out to those who want to help.

Through 2005, SOAP had the largest match video archive in all of FIRST. The popularity of the program led the students to explore other avenues of content delivery. Because uploading matches during the competition was a slow process, SOAP began to burn free CD's for all teams that were at any event 108 attended. Teams loved the idea, but the cost and effort it took eventually led to the cancellation of the CD distribution program after the 2006 season.

As similar initiatives sprouted and student availability diminished in the mid 2000's, SOAP was forced to rethink their approach. Sites like The Blue Alliance were able to accomplish what SOAP has done all of these years while adding some much needed functionality, pushing the bar further. In 2008, an alumnus of 108 and former SOAP lead came to the rescue with a FRC live event portal named SOAP Gameday. Gameday's basic top level experience combines webcasts, live event data (scores, rankings, etc), and a chat together in one easy-to-use web interface, all in real-time. This simplifies the steps needed to track the events as they happen and immerses you in the data, providing an experience never really accomplished before 2008\. Since 2008, a new an improved version of Gameday has been introduced each season. A new version has been announced for 2010.
