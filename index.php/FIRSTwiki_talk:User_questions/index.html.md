# FIRSTwiki talk:User questions

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Okay, I changed the format a bit (well, a lot). I think it's time we come here
and do some major editing, ... we've got the help pages and the new user pages
and the editing and contributing pages mostly in order, so this seems to be
the other major thing that new users will be coming to. See [Wikipedia:Wikiped
ia:Overview_FAQ](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ
"wikipedia:Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ" ) for the design. So that the old content
can be merged into the pages, refer to [the old version](http://www.firstwiki.
org/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:User_questions&oldid=5721
"http://www.firstwiki.org/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:User_questions&oldid=5721"
). It'll be a lot of work, but many of the questions we can take from
wikipedia--although we'll have to tailor the answers to us, of course. I'll
try to start, but we'll definatley need more input.

_Major formatting request..._

All that bold makes it hard to focus on something, and not very visually
stimulating. Not to say questions shouldn't be bolded, but I think we might
take a page from
[wikipedia:wikipedia:FAQ](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:FAQ
"wikipedia:wikipedia:FAQ" ) and totally revamp this page.

Then why does Brandon have two pages: [user:Brandon
Martus](/index.php/User:Brandon_Martus "User:Brandon Martus" ) and [Brandon
Martus](/index.php/Brandon_Martus "Brandon Martus" ) that are both being
updated? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:32, 29 May 2004 (EDT)

    Fixed. I think they had the same content. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 20:38, 29 May 2004 (EDT)

I'm thinking we remove citations from the user questions page altogether. Just
needless assaulting the new user's eyes with too much information and we don't
really need to take credit... Doing so now. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max
