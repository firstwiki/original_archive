Name: Kyle Hughes WFA Year: 2000 Years involved w/FIRST: 8 FIRST Team(s): Team Rush (0027) Role: Team Leader Quote: Attitude is a choice. Bio: Kyle Hughes' mentorship to the students of Team Rush #27 for eight years is well renowned. Kyle has proved that the boundaries of being a successful parent/mentor can be intermingled.

What was it like to win the WFA?: Winning the WFA was the most honorable moment I have ever experienced! It topped the Presidential Award by far!

Favorite FIRST Memory: Watching the unbelievable display of people who were nominated for the WFA in 2000 – thinking that I didn't even qualify to have my name up there (with some of the others). Then hearing my name and handing Cody (my 9-week old son), to Dennis (my husband) so I could run/walk (actually waddle) down the stadium to receive my WFA! Afterwards, my students were so proud ... they even walked in front of Cody's stroller acting as bodyguards through the crazy crowds at the Epcot party! It was a great night – one I will never forget!

FIRST accomplishments: There are many ... Team RUSH has been around for eleven years. However, my personal FIRST accomplishments (aside from the WFA), were the UTC Teacher Pioneer Award, having my student, Becky Sherman win the Design Your Future Award, having 2 students, Lyron Maxey and Seth Henderson, win the Kettering Scholarships. The rewards of a teacher are usually many years later ... knowing that I have made an impact on the students that I had in class. Probably my most important FIRST accomplishment is having my alumni go out and spread the word of FIRST by starting new and supporting existing teams while in college. My students are just now going out and joining teams with their new places of employment (after college)! The incredible circle of life ... this stuff does pay off.

What are you up to these days: Still teaching mathematics and technology. Still coaching FIRST – Team RUSH. Still raising 3 kids (who believe FIRST and robots are a "normal" way of life).

Advice to FIRST-ers: Set your goals. Continue to believe. As long as you don't give up on yourself, you will succeed.

What does mentoring mean to you?: An opportunity to help someone else so that when "being on the cutting edge", the "edges" aren't so sharp. Mentoring means giving advice/help to speed up the learning curve, or to just see situations that you know you've experienced – and be able to share your experiences with someone else. Mentoring is critical! There should always be a Master and an Apprentice with mentoring ... and the circle continues.

Other Stuff: I finally have the opportunity to say thank you to the person who has allowed me many opportunities ... my husband, Dennis Hughes. Many people know him as one of the guys in the RUSH Pits, but he has been the engineer behind the scenes with team RUSH since the beginning. He has been my inspiration, my support, my encouragement, and my best pal. If it weren't for Dennis and his true belief in me, I would never have had the strength to do what we do with FIRST. Dennis and I make a great team because I let him handle the robot stuff, and I handle the rest. Thank you Dennis for believing in me – and for always lurking in my shadow, cheering me on and reminding me that I can do anything I set my mind to.

Kyle Hughes has taken Team #27 to new heights, and has proved a worthy hero for all mentors in FIRST.
