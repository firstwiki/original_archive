## Virginia, government square off over healthcare

RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - The state of Virginia and the government were pitched in a legal battle in a federal courtroom on Thursday that could lead to the undoing of the massive healthcare reform law passed three months ago.

"The whole bill falls if we prevail and the individual mandate is found unconstitutional," he said, adding that there is no way to severe the provision from the rest of the law.

At the heart of the federal argument is the idea that all Americans participate in a healthcare marketplace even when they do not have insurance. Because they already engage in commerce, Gershengorn said, the Commerce Clause applies to their decision to purchase or not to purchase insurance.

"This is a radical, radical claim of power,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/")," said Virginia Solicitor General Duncan Getchell

Virginia's Republican Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli would not comment on the likelihood that Hudson will dismiss the suit, but said he was "cautiously optimistic we have a better than even chance of prevailing."

Virginia says the healthcare law would represent the first time the U.S. government forces its citizens to buy something.

Hudson seemed skeptical of the idea that everyone in the country participates in the commerce of healthcare,Related Theme Articles:

<p>U.S. Department of Justice attorney Ian Gershengorn argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Virginia lacks standing to challenge the healthcare law. Instead, he said, a person having to pay a fine for not having health insurance as required by the new law would have to sue.</p>

<p>Gershengorn warned that if Virginia's law is allowed to trump federal law, other states could decide to pass laws saying their citizens do not have to participate in other federal programs,[Louis Vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonlouisvuitton.com/"), such as the gas tax, U.S. census or military draft.</p>

<p>Cuccinelli said the healthcare law was an example of the federal government extending its reach beyond the limits the Constitution places on its power.</p>

<p>Some $43 billion a year is spent on treating people who don't have health insurance, Gershengorn said.</p>

<p>If the case is not dismissed, both sides will return to court on October 18 for a summary judgment. If it is dismissed, Virginia will likely appeal and keep the suit in the courts. Regardless, other lawsuits will proceed,Related Theme Articles:

<p>While the judge will only decide if the suit can proceed -- a decision Hudson said he would render within 30 days -- the court heard the first airing of arguments that could make their way to the Supreme Court as some states resist implementing the law.</p>

<p>Although some provisions of the healthcare law came on-line on Thursday, including a tax on tanning salons intended to partially pay for the reforms and a centralized federal healthcare Web site, the individual mandate is set to go into effect in 2014.</p>

<p>The findings do not prove that a tendency toward sweating helps shield active people from exercise-induced asthma, according to Dr. Warren Lockette,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/ "http://www.usoutletlouisvuitton.com/"), the senior researcher on the work.</p>

<p>Essentially,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), they say, people who sweat less may also have drier airways, which could make the airways more likely to constrict and cause breathing problems during exercise.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Active people who are prone to sweating may have some built-in protection from exercise-induced asthma attacks, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>However, he explained in a statement, the results are consistent with the idea that a common mechanism may underlie diminished sweat production and reduced water secretion in the airways.</p>

<p>SOURCE: Chest, September 2008.</p>

<p>The unusual connection suggests that the same mechanisms responsible for generating a person's sweat "volume" also determines the amount of water secreted by the airways,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-bags.com/ "http://www.guccibags-bags.com/"), the researchers speculate.</p>

<p>The researchers also gave the study participants a drug called pilocarpine, which induces sweat and saliva production.</p>

<p>They found that volunteers who tended to sweat the most in response to the drug were less likely to show airway constriction after being given methacholine. Heavy sweaters also tended to have greater saliva and tear production.</p>

<p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Roger Federer has done everything necessary to etch his name in the annals of tennis immortality and all that remains for the Swiss world number one is to add more grand slams to his remarkable tally of 15.</p>

<p>"This year is quite different and I just hope it won't finish that way," the third seed said.</p>

<p>There were some encouraging signs when the world number two helped Spain win the Davis Cup last month then made last week's final in Qatar to give himself a confidence lift.</p>

<p>NADAL LOOMS</p>

<p>"That's important for the career, for the future, and of course if I want to fight for the number one."</p>

<p>But in the blink of eye, the aggressive left-hander plummeted back down to earth from his lofty perch when his knees began to buckle and the injuries started to mount up. He took a break from the game and has not won any title since May.</p>

<p>"I am never going to say that I am going to win it... (but) I am playing well enough to have a positive result. And I am happy," he said.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old has been steadily improving over the past two seasons but his breakthrough win in New York was proof he is ready to mix it with the best and given him the confidence to set his sights even higher.</p>

<p>Despite his uncertain buildup, Federer remains the pre-tournament favorite. After all,[LV Bags](http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), he has made the final of 17 of the last 18 grand slams, dating back to Wimbledon in 2005.</p>

<p>Last season,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), Federer ticked the two remaining boxes on his career checklist when he won the French Open for the first time before breaking Pete Sampras's record of grand slam men's singles titles.</p>

<p>He then turned down the chance to play in the Kooyong Classic,[Louis Vuitton Outlet](http://www.outlet-louisvuitton-outlet.com/ "http://www.outlet-
louisvuitton-outlet.com/"), an eight-man exhibition in Melbourne that he had used to fine-tune his preparations each time he won the Australian Open.</p>

<p>He did reach the U.S. Open final in 2008 and his early season form has been impressive, giving him renewed hope he can join the grand slam winners club.</p>

<p>Andy Murray will again carry the weight of expectation of a British public starved of grand slam success. The Scotsman was one of the favorites to win the Australian Open last year but crashed out in the fourth round.</p>

<p>His biggest challenge now is to maintain his motivation and while Federer insists he remains as keen as ever, the Australian Open could provide the first real glimpse into what lies ahead for his opponents.</p>

<p>"When I go to the court with Roger,[Gucci Bags](http://www.guccibags-

<p>A new challenger emerged last year in the shape of Juan Martin del Potro, the giant Argentine who won the U.S. Open, beating Federer in the final.</p>

<p>Roddick won the Australian Open junior title in 2000 and has been a semi-finalist in the senior event on four occasions but goes into Melbourne in great form after winning last week's Brisbane International.</p>

<p>Nadal was on top of the world 12 months ago. He had beaten Federer in the finals at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2008 to spirit away the number one ranking then reduced the Swiss to tears by beating him at Melbourne Park.</p>

<p>Overall,[Louis Vuitton Factory Outlet](http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonfactoryoutlet4.com/"), almost half the patients died within a year of their heart attacks in 1996, while fewer than four in ten died in 2006.</p>

<p>The drop in mortality only occurred in patients who had undergone invasive procedures, suggesting those treatments might help patients survive longer. But it's possible that other changes in how doctors managed the patients could also have been involved.</p>

<p>CHICAGO (Reuters) - Obesity decreases the chances that a woman will get pregnant, and the more obese she is, the worse her prospects of conception, Dutch researchers said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>"It is possible that obese women may have disturbed hormone levels,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"), which decrease the chances of successful fertilization and implantation," he said.</p>

<p>Obesity is already known to disrupt ovulation, and the Dutch study now suggests it can lower pregnancy rates compared with women of normal weight.</p>

<p>The researchers found that women with a BMI of 30 or higher had significantly lower probability of becoming pregnant naturally,[coach outlet online](http://www.coachoutlet-usonline.net/ "http://www.coachoutlet-
usonline.net/"), compared with normal weight women who had BMIs of between 21 and 29.</p>

<p>Dr. Jan Willem van der Steeg and colleagues looked at the relationship between fertility in these women and their body mass index, a ratio of weight to height. Women with a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese.</p>

<p>The study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, included more than 3,[polo outlet](http://www.poloutletsale.com/ "http://www.poloutletsale.com/"),000 couples between 2002 and 2004 in 24 hospitals in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Researchers at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam looked at how obesity affects women who are still ovulating but having trouble with conception.</p>

<p>One reason for this may be the hormone leptin, which regulates appetite and energy expenditure and is secreted in fatty tissues.</p>

## Healthy waist may be a bit bigger for black women

<p>The same pattern was seen when it came to waist size. For men and white women,[Louis Vuitton Bags](http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/ "http://www.www.louisvuittnubags.com/"), the waistline thresholds in this study were close to the 40-inch and 35-inch standards, respectively.</p>

<p>One possibility, he said, is that white and black women have differences in the specific areas of the body that fat tends to accumulate -- and men may not have those differences.</p>

<p>High risk in this case meant having two or more risk factors for those diseases -- such as high blood pressure,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), high cholesterol or elevated blood sugar.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The definition of a 'healthy' waistline may have a bit more wiggle room for African-American women than for white women, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>Among African-American women, however, the "high-risk" waistline was slightly more than 38 inches -- 3 inches larger than the standard threshold.</p>

<p>Another way to look at the weight-health question is through body mass index (BMI) -- a measure of weight in relation to height. People with a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese,[Cheap NFL Jerseys](http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/ "http://www.jerseyoutlet.org/"), and they generally have a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease than thinner people.</p>

<p>For white women and men of both races, a BMI of about 30 was the threshold -- the same as the standard value. But among black women, it was 33.</p>

<p>He also stressed that the findings do not mean that African-American women with a BMI below 33 or a waistline under 38 inches have "no risk" of obesity-related health problems.</p>

```
    Health
```

<p>That suggests that the average black woman can be heavier than her white counterpart before her risk for heart disease and diabetes start to climb dramatically.</p>

<p>The findings are based on 6,476 adult volunteers who had their weight, blood pressure and other health factors measured as part of a larger study of obesity, lifestyle and chronic disease risks. Just over 2,[coachoutlet](http://store-coachoutlet.com/ "http://store-coachoutlet.com/"),400 participants were African American.</p>

<p>"What the study does show is that there is a strong relationship between obesity and risk factors in white and African-American men and women," Katzmarzyk said. "This relationship is robust in all groups, so no one is immune from the effects of obesity."</p>

<p>But in the new study, researchers found that African-American women might have somewhat higher thresholds for a risky waist size and BMI.</p>

<p>For the study, reported in the journal Obesity, researchers tried to estimate the BMI and waist size that best separated people at relatively high risk for diabetes and heart disease from those at lower risk.</p>

<p>Still, more research is needed to show that, according to lead researcher Dr. Peter T. Katzmarzyk, a professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>

## Scientists find blood protein link to Alzheimer's

<p>The number of dementia sufferers is expected to balloon in future decades as populations around the world age. Alzheimer's Disease International predicts numbers will almost double every 20 years to 66 million in 2030 and over 115 million in 2050.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - High levels of a blood protein called clusterin are linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease, scientists said on Monday -- a finding which could pave the way for doctors to detect the disease before it takes hold.</p>

<p>Drugs can relieve some of the symptoms for a while, but patients gradually lose their memories, their ability to navigate and understand the world, and to care for themselves.</p>

<p>"We found that this clusterin protein was increased in blood as much as 10 years before people had the signs of Alzheimer's disease in their brains," said Simon Lovestone, who led the study. "And even when they had signs of disease in their brains, they still had no clinical signs of the disorder -- so this suggests that this is a really, really early change that occurs in people who are going to get the disease."</p>

<p>Lovestone said the next step -- which should take about a year -- would be to develop a better test, since the one they used for the study would not be suitable for use in clinics. "Once we've then designed the better test, we need to look at it in larger groups of people to see if our results are replicated,Related Theme Articles:

"That whole process will take between three to five years."</p>

<p>This research team used a technique called proteomics,Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://loveacougarforwildlife.com/blogs/posts/xison9jdidn><li> ; , which analyses proteins, to conduct two "discovery phase" studies in 95 patients and found that clusterin appeared to be linked with the early signs of Alzheimer's. The findings were published in the Archives of General Psychiatry journal.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia -- a brain-wasting condition that affects around 35 million people around the world -- and despite decades of research,[jordan shoes](http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/ "http://www.jordanshoesonline.org/"), doctors still have few effective weapons against it.</p>

```

<p>"We think this is the first step toward finding a prodromal or preclinical test for the disease," Lovestone said. A prodromal test is one that can detect very early signs of a disease before any specific symptoms are showing.</p>

<p>Lovestone said it was important to stress there was still a lot more work to do before a test could be used by doctors in clinics,[louis vuitton outlet online](http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonsoutletonlinea.com/"), but said such a technique may in future become part of a range of tests to find people with early signs of the disease.</p>

<p>"If I look toward the future, such tests might be used as part of a staging process. I can imagine people first having a blood test and then those people who have high levels of clusterin might go on to have more intensive investigations."</p>

<p>Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London said that while doctors are around 5 years away from being able to use the discovery for a test to identify future Alzheimer's sufferers,[Coach Outlet](http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/ "http://www.coachoutletstoreline2012.com/"), it was a big step along the way.</p>

<p>Express Scripts is one of three big companies that buy pharmaceuticals for U.S. employers and health plans.</p>

<p>Spending on these so-called specialty drugs was about $54 billion in 2006 and is expected to rise to $99 billion by 2010, the report by pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Inc. said.</p>

<p>The increase is due largely to higher prices and new uses for drugs originally approved for rare conditions.</p>

<p>Top drugs included $2.7 billion for Johnson & Johnson's Remicade for arthritis, and $3.7 billion for Celgene Corp.'s cancer drug Thalomid.</p>

# Cash-strapped states bet on corporate tax cuts

<p>The state-level debate mimics a larger debate simmering for months about how to trim the corporate rate on the federal level, now 35 percent -- among the highest in developed countries.</p>

<p>Corporate taxes make up a small share of state coffers, but they are still among states' three biggest revenue sources.</p>

<p>Republicans took control over six states in the 2010 elections, and now control 29 of the 50 state houses.</p>

<p>That is an inefficient way of luring business activity,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/"), said Mark Robyn, staff economist at the conservative leaning Tax Foundation think tank.</p>

<p>On the state level, though, there is not much talk of trimming special credits and deductions to broaden the tax base to pay for a rate cut.</p>

<p>On the national stage, Obama and many fellow Democrats want to trim tax breaks for narrow slices of industry to pay for a rate cut,Related Theme Articles:

<li>[http://www.openideaswiki.comUser:Xison8pdidn#U.S._accuse d_of_failing_ill_1991_Gulf_War_veterans](http://www.openideaswiki.comUser:Xison8pdidn#U.S._accuse
d_of_failing_ill_1991_Gulf_War_veterans)<li> , while Republicans say a boost in growth will help offset the cost.</p>

<p>LOW RETURNS?</p>

<p>"In most cases, it is states with new Republican governors who feel like they were elected on a mandate to cut taxes," said Meg Gray Wiehe, state tax policy director with the liberal-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. "It is not really a flush time to do this."</p>

<p>Rhode Island is an exception, where the governor, a former Republican turned independent, wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 7.5 percent from 9 percent, but also close loopholes.</p>

<p>In fiscal 2009, states collected about $40 billion in corporate taxes out of $715 billion in total taxes,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"),Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://willsocial.com/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/1194235><li> ; , according to U.S. Census data.</p>

```
    Politics Money
```

<p>State corporate tax rates range from zero to about 10 percent and generally vary by income bracket.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican governors across the United States are betting that now is the time to cut corporate taxes,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), despite the tattered condition of state budgets.</p>

<p>Emboldened after taking a majority of state governors' mansions, Republicans are pitching at least a dozen proposals to slash state corporate taxes this year. Less than a handful of states are mulling plans to boost them.</p>

<p>"From our perspective the right type of corporate tax reform is lowering the rates,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/")," Robyn said. "It is hard to measure a job created and you may end up giving money to companies that might have created a job anyway."</p>

<p>"I am just struck by the constant refrain about corporate tax cuts," said Alan Viard,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "States are more eager to get businesses now when their economies are weak; on the other hand the revenue loss is troubling if they do it now."</p>

<p>CREDITS, SPECIAL TAX BREAKS</p>

<p>Lower corporate rates stir some economic activity, many economists say, but how far low rates can enhance a state's competitiveness is a matter of degree,Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://justiciagratis.com/blogs/viewstory/62734><li> , and debate.</p>

<p>Most of the proposals come from newly-elected Republican governors.</p>

<p>States are operating under an assumption that businesses will move for better tax rates and preferences, Fox said.</p>

<p>Some states are taking a slightly different tack, boosting credits for hiring new workers, a policy backed by the Obama administration, which pushed for its enactment on the federal level.</p>

<p>"Usually corporations decide where to locate based on a multitude of factors including what the workforce is like," said William Fox, an economics professor at the University of Tennessee.</p>

<p>Backers of rate cuts also say workers ultimately bear the brunt of higher taxes.</p>

<p>States are just now beginning to recover from the recession and 44 states face a combined $112 billion shortfall in their budgets, which generally must be balanced each year by law.</p>

<p>But while both Democrats and Republicans publicly agree steep taxes relative to other countries are harmful for competitiveness, they have not resolved the thornier debate of how to pay for cuts.</p>

<p>Republican Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who made headlines by curbing public union bargaining rights, for example, wants to give companies more time to use losses to offset tax liabilities.</p>

<p>Even if Republican governors are able to win support for their corporate tax rate reform,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), the cuts may not do much over the short- term to dig states out of their budget holes.</p>

<p>The biggest impact a corporate rate cut may have on business is the symbolic gesture.</p>

<p>"The research says you can attract a small amount of economic activity by lowering the corporate income tax rate, but it doesn't change the scope of the state," Fox said.</p>

<p>(Additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago and Lisa Lambert in Washington, editing by Dave Zimmerman)</p>

<p>"Probably the best argument (for cutting corporate tax rates) is that you are signaling to business that you are trying to be competitive," said Robert Ward, deputy director at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a think tank on state finance.</p>

# Steve Jobs death spawns collectibles, but few sales

<p>And that, she says, is where the real value lies.</p>

<p>So the only known wiring harness from Jobs' first Apple office, as an example, might not fetch much: Who cares? But a computer from Apple's infancy that's out-of-the-box new and still working? Now you're talking,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), especially if you have all the instruction manuals and shipping trinkets (giveaway stickers, for example) that collectors call "case candy."</p>

<p>A "Macintosh" poster with Picasso-like line graphics, made to promote the first Mac in 1984,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), is still up grabs for $500.</p>

<p>Tom Slater, director of Americana auctions at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, said the future price of any Jobs-related collectibles will depend more on its condition than any correlation to his death.</p>

<p>By Lou Carlozo</p>

<p>Barry didn't set out to become an Apple collector when she started buying machines such as the PowerBook Duo or Apple's Xserve. But she didn't get rid of them either, and today owns about a dozen, including a 20th anniversary Mac from 1997 that still runs and connects to the Internet.</p>

<p>"If you have a newspaper with a cover story about the sinking of the Titanic that's separating along fold lines and crumbles to the touch, it would not have much value," Slater said. "But a copy in nice condition would be very collectible."</p>

<p>So yes, that Lisa looks tempting but Barry plans to hold off. As she sums it, the Jobs philosophy of mixing tech, art and play -- which devotees call "The Apple Way" -- so far appears untouched by his passing.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - When rock stars die,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/"), any trinket connected to their history soars in value. And certainly,Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://kurortgid.ru/node/35604><li> , Steve Jobs was the tech equivalent of a John Lennon or Jimi Hendrix.</p>

<p>While others might see junky old machines, Barry and her ilk see the first expressions of a tech pioneer and one who carried himself more like an artist.</p>

<p>The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.</p>

<p>"It was amusing that Apple reverse-engineered the name into 'Local Integrated Software Architecture,'" she added, noting it spawned some cheeky parodies,Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://frz.site90.com/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/34681><li> , including "Let's Invent Some Acronym" and 'Lisa: Invented Stupid Acronym."</p>

<p>Nor did hyperbole help; Jobs shirts with the tag "iGod" proved downright mortal, with little sales action. And what would Jobs, an innovator in minimalist design, think of the cheesy-looking bobbleheads of him at $44.99?</p>

<p>"We were so Mac crazy that I co-founded the first commercial Internet applications company on the Mac platform,Related Theme Articles:

<p>Which brings us back to that Lisa computer on eBay, coveted by Apple collectors such as Mikki Barry not just because of its rarity but because Lisa was also the name of Jobs' oldest daughter.</p>

<p>One seller from Mount Vernon, New York, sought a starting bid of $1,500 for a still-working Apple Lisa computer from 1984,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), with a Buy It Now price of $4,000\. As of Tuesday afternoon, that price had dropped 25 percent, to $3,000.</p>

<p>But the death of the Apple co-founder last week had no such effect on Apple collectibles, from still-working 1980s computers to floppy disc sets (see link.reuters.com/jac44s for more info).</p>

<p>On the vintage side, auction bays generated scarcely more heat. An Apple 2e from 1982,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), complete with original green-screen monitor, had fielded just one bid at $50\. Maybe the missing "delete" key had something to do with it.</p>

<p>(Editing by Lauren Young and Beth Gladstone)</p>

<p>Obscurity also helps, though the Apple trinket in and of itself must have collector's cache.</p>

<p>"Steve gave it such a personal name, from his daughter Lisa," said Barry, director of contracts at SNVC, an IT solutions firm in Fairfax, Virginia.</p>

<p>"There is no need to rush out and buy more collectibles," she says, "because Apple will keep making better and better toys."</p>

<p>Instead,[gucci outlet](http://www.outletsbags.org/ "http://www.outletsbags.org/"), the flood of media coverage has spawned a tsunami of iJunk with very few takers, while prices for bona-fide Apple treasures have remained pretty much where they stood a month ago.</p>

<p>Bolt has said repeatedly that both training for and racing the 400 would be too painful an experience but he did concede this year that a further debate with Mills is on the cards after the season ends.</p>

An unknown number of Democrats are expected to join Republicans in voting against the measure,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), leaving the final margin too close to call.</p>

<p>But with Republicans united in opposition,[burberry outlet online](http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/ "http://www.burberryoutletonline2012.net/"), Democrats struggled to line up the 218 votes needed to pass the bill. "It's going to be tight," a Democratic aide said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the House of Representatives scrambled on Wednesday to iron out lingering concerns over abortion in a healthcare reform bill that was headed to a close and potentially historic weekend debate.</p>

<p>House Democratic leaders planned a Saturday vote on the sweeping overhaul,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), which would launch the biggest changes to the U.S. healthcare system since the creation of the Medicare health program for the elderly in 1965.</p>

<p>Special election victories in California and New York gave Democrats two new members and two more likely "yes" votes on the healthcare bill, and leaders made plans to swear in the new members quickly so they could vote.</p>

<p>The overhaul,[gucci shoes](http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/ "http://www.shoesguccioutlet.net/"), President Barack Obama's top domestic priority, is designed to rein in costs, expand coverage to millions of uninsured and bar insurance practices, such as denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>He and other abortion opponents argue federal subsidies under the bill would help pay for insurance plans that include abortion coverage, which means federal funds would be going toward abortions.</p>

<p>Stupak wants to bar any federally subsidized insurance plan from paying for abortions, including government-run public plans created to compete with private insurers.</p>

<p>Democratic leaders hoped to defuse a potential uprising by moderates within the party who want stronger language to ensure federal funds are not used to pay for abortions under the bill.</p>

<p>'UP IN THE AIR'</p>

<p>House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter said she expected the rule-setting guidelines for the healthcare debate would incorporate anti- abortion language proposed by Representative Brad Ellsworth, a moderate Democrat.</p>

<p>His amendment would prohibit the use of federal funds to cover abortions and also guarantee access to insurance plans that would agree to refrain from covering abortion.</p>

<p>The group prefers a proposal by Representative Bart Stupak, who leads about 40 moderate Democrats vowing to oppose the bill unless it is changed to their satisfaction on abortion.</p>

```
    Politics Health Small Business Healthcare Reform
```

<p>(Editing by Paul Simao)</p>

<p>The House bill would require individuals to buy insurance and all but the smallest employers to offer health coverage to workers. It also provide subsidies to help purchase insurance and would eliminate the industry's exemption from federal antitrust laws.</p>

<p>Ellsworth said "three or four" moderate Democrats had approached him to say his proposal would win their vote. That might be enough for Democrats, and every vote could be crucial when the House takes up the measure on Saturday.</p>

<p>Ellsworth's amendment has been attacked by some anti-abortion Democrats and the National Right to Life Committee, which called it "a political fig leaf" and urged Democrats to vote down any rule that included it.</p>

<p>"We are on the verge of doing something great," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), told reporters.</p>

<p>WILMINGTON,[burberry outlet](http://www.outletbags2012.com/ "http://www.outletbags2012.com/"), Delaware (Reuters) - The bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team has not paid or lent money to team owner Frank McCourt over the last two years, the team's chief financial officer told creditors on Wednesday.</p>

<p>(Reporting by Tom Hals; editing by Andre Grenon)</p>

<p>The Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 protection in June after the league rejected a proposed $3 billion deal for future television rights, in part because some of that money was earmarked for McCourt's personal use.</p>

# Penn State officials to stand trial in abuse scandal

<p>McQueary said he witnessed the abuse on a Friday night, but it was not until Saturday that he told Paterno, who then waited for the close of the weekend to notify Curley and Schultz, who was in charge of campus police at the time.</p>

<p>The explosive allegations against Sandusky have shocked the university and the college-sports world, and focused national attention on the serious problem of child sex abuse.</p>

<p>Failure to immediately notify local police has resulted in accusations of a cover-up and the firing of Penn State president Graham Spanier as well as Paterno. Both McQueary and Curley were placed on administrative leave and Schultz has retired to prepare his criminal defense.</p>

<p>Now that the case is going to trial, it will be up to a jury to decide "whether McQueary has the credibility to address the high level of proof required to determine perjury," said Curley's attorney,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), Caroline Roberto.</p>

<p>District Judge William Wenner decided there was enough evidence against former Penn State athletic director Tim Curley and finance official Gary Schultz that they should be brought to trial.</p>

<p>McQueary testified that he did tell Schultz about the incident and in doing so,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"), "I thought I was talking to the head of police." He said he considered Schultz a sort of district attorney who "would know what to do" with the information.</p>

<p>Asked if he used the phrase "anal intercourse" when he talked to Paterno about the incident, McQueary said, "No, out of respect,[burberry outlet](http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/ "http://www.2012burberryoutlet.net/"),Related Theme Articles:

<p>McQueary's father, John McQueary, also testified on Friday. He said that in a meeting with Schultz after the event his son was told there had been a "noise level" about other incidents involving Sandusky, but the university "was never able to unearth anything or sink our teeth into anything substantial."</p>

<p>The story told by McQueary, a graduate assistant in the university's football program at the time, is key to the case against the two Penn State officials and Sandusky. This is because McQueary testified that he personally witnessed the abuse and then told his boss,Related Theme Articles:

<p>(Additional reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Greg McCune and Jerry Norton)</p>

<p>"I believe he was sexually molesting the boy," McQueary testified at the hearing in the Dauphin County Courthouse on Friday.</p>

<p>Asked by Schultz's attorney Tom Farrell if Sandusky had an erection, McQueary said: "I don't know. I didn't look and stare down there." Asked if he saw pain on the boy's face, McQueary said "no."</p>

<p>The ruling capped a court hearing where a key witness, Mike McQueary, testified in public for the first time that he saw Sandusky in a sex act with a 10-year-old boy in 2002.</p>

<p>Key testimony at trial will also come from Paterno, who turns 85 next week, either in person or collected earlier,Related Theme Articles:

<p>Paterno told him, "I'm sorry you had to see that" and that McQueary had "done the absolute right thing," he testified.</p>

<p>"I heard rhythmic slapping sounds, two or three slaps that sounded like skin on skin."</p>

<p>McQueary, who was 28 at the time, testified that after witnessing the alleged incident he told his father: "I just saw coach Sandusky. What I saw was wrong and sexual."</p>

<p>He said he had never confronted Sandusky himself about the incident, and that while he had "absolutely without a doubt" considered calling police, he did not.</p>

<p>McQueary spoke for two hours at the preliminary hearing in a courtroom packed with about 100 reporters and as many as 60 members of the public.</p>

<p>HARRISBURG, Pa (Reuters) - A judge ruled on Friday that two former senior Penn State officials must stand trial on charges of lying to a grand jury about what they knew of sexual abuse allegations against former coach Jerry Sandusky.</p>

<p>Curley and Schultz deny that they lied to the grand jury and say that Paterno and McQueary only told them in general terms about the incident and not in graphic detail.</p>

<p>Sandusky has been charged with 52 counts of child sexual abuse involving 10 victims over 15 years. The identity of two of the victims, including the boy in the shower, remains unknown, prosecutors said. Sandusky has said he is innocent.</p>

<p>Referring to his son's description of the sounds of the incident, the elder McQueary said while neither he nor Mike used the word thrusting, "you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out a sound like that would be thrusting."</p>

<p>Even though McQueary's account was passed up the line of authority at Penn State, no one told police and Sandusky's alleged behavior continued for years.</p>

<p>Paterno appeared "shocked and saddened" at what McQueary saw, and "slumped back in his chair," said McQueary, who was dressed in court in a dark suit,[louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com "http://www.louisvuittonsfr.com"), white shirt and blue tie.</p>

<p>"It's bittersweet I didn't make the team," Ross said. "I'll definitely be on that podium again."</p>

<p>Nieto and Kynard will join Williams in London, but Ross will stay at home because he does not have the required standard.</p>

<p>"The semis are so unforgivable. ....But once you make the finals it's anyone's race."</p>

<p>Williams missed three times at 2.31 meters after clearing 2.28 on his third attempt on a wet and cold day in Eugene but clinched his spot on the American team because the third place finisher did not have the "A" qualifying standard.</p>

<p>Cudwort's attorney Richard Shonfeld said in a telephone interview on Saturday that he was glad that the jury held Jones accountable.,[バーバリーアウトレット](http://www.burberrywebs.org/ "http://www.burberrywebs.org/")</p>

<p>Jones was suspended from playing in the NFL by Commissioner Roger Goodell in 2007 and in 2008 for violations of the league's personal conduct policy.</p>

<p>The Clark County jury on Friday awarded Thomas Urbanski $9.6 million in compensatory damages for a gunshot injury that left him paralyzed from the waist down, according to online court records. Urbanski was the manager of the Minxx club.</p>

<p>Urbanski's wife, Kathleen, was awarded $750,000 for loss of consortium.</p>

<p>The Bengals signed Jones for the 2012 season after he played only eight games last season because of injuries.</p>

<p>According to police reports, the incident occurred after Jones "made it rain" by throwing money into the air.

<p>In the last 11 years, Venus has won five and Serena four Wimbledon singles titles with only Sharapova and the retired Amelie Mauresmo breaking the Williams monopoly on the lawns.</p>

<p>With sister Venus also back from a five-month lay-off in time for the grasscourt slam the sisters have dominated for a decade, the women's tournament has suddenly been catapulted out of the shadow of the men's event.</p>

<p>Any weaknesses in their games will be fully exposed over the two-week slog, however,[Ralph Lauren Casquette](http://www.poiie.com/ralph-lauren-

<p>They have overcome adversity over the years, suffering personal tragedies such as the murder of one of their sisters as well as battling many injuries and instances of racist abuse.</p>

<p>With an Australian Open runner-up finish and then her glorious run in Paris, she has proved she has what it takes to win the game's major prizes.</p>

<p>"Serena is a great champion so it's always great to see great champions back on the tennis court," second seed Zvonareva told Reuters at Eastbourne.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Serena Williams has won titles after overcoming adversity before but if she retains her Wimbledon singles crown just months after a scrape with death it would represent the American's greatest comeback.</p>

<p>Instead, with a near-perfect sense of timing,[バーバリーセール](http://www.burwe.com/ "http://www.burwe.com/"), the 29 -year-old made her comeback at Eastbourne this week and, despite precious little competitive play, will open Center Court proceedings on Tuesday as she begins the defense of the title.</p>

<p>All eyes will be on the baseliner as she tries to end the debate about her number one credentials and she will hope for a better showing than she managed last year when she was thrashed 6-2 6-0 by Kvitova in the last 16.</p>

<p>"They add excitement to women's tennis and create another challenge."</p>

<p>Many thought the 13-times grand slam winner's career was over when she suffered potentially fatal blood clots in a lung during her recovery after slicing a tendon in her foot on broken glass,Related Theme Articles:

<p>That is why,[コーチ](http://www.jcoan.com/ "http://www.jcoan.com/"), despite their woes this year and fall in the rankings which means Serena is seeded seventh and Venus 23rd, it would not be a huge surprise to see them on opposite sides of the net in the July 2 final if the draw keeps them apart.</p>

<p>Neither will be worried by their lower rankings since Serena won the 2007 Australian Open wh
ile ranked 81 in the world and six months later Venus triumphed at Wimbledon as the 23rd seed, with both having returned from lengthy layoffs.</p>

<p>"Everyone was going a little crazy. But I just want to prepare for Wimbledon now because I've always done well there."</p>

<p>"I turned my phone off for three days," she said at Eastbourne this week.</p>

<p>Provided she shakes off the illness that disrupted her grasscourt preparations she will fear no one in the draw, not even the Williams sisters.</p>

<p>"Double the excitement and double the intrigue," was how former Wimbledon great Chris Evert described the effect the American siblings would have in leafy south west London.</p>

<p>World number two Kim Clijsters has withdrawn with a foot injury but China's Li Na, the French Open champion, world number one Caroline Wozniacki, former winner Maria Sharapova and Zvonareva will all be contenders, while the likes of Victoria Azarenka and Petra Kvitova could also go far.</p>

<p>Without the Williams sisters in the draw, the title could have been a little hollow.</p>

<p>She beat Vera Zvonareva in last year's final and the Russian got some revenge this week when she knocked out Williams in the second round at the Wimbledon warm-up event on the south coast.</p>

<p>"The sharp drop in exports is a major concern for the economic outlook as it is an indication that the pace of global activity may be slowing appreciably," said TD Securities' Mulraine.</p>

<p>DOWNWARD TREND IN CLAIMS</p>

<p>As a result of the wider trade shortfall, economists estimated the second-quarter's already weak annual growth pace of 1.3 percent could be revised to 0.9 percent.</p>

<p>Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 395,000, the Labor Department said, the lowest level since early April. Economists had expected a reading of 400,[ブランドバッグ 激安](http://www.iburans.com/ "http://www.iburans.com/"),000.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell to a four-month low last week, a sliver of hope for an economy battered for days by a credit rating downgrade and falling share prices.</p>

```
    Small Business Money
```

<p>The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that economic growth was considerably weaker than expected and unemployment would fall only gradually. The U.S. central bank promised to keep interest rates near zero until at least mid-2013.</p>

<p>Hiring accelerated in July after abruptly slowing in the previous two months. However, there are worries that a sharp sell-off in stocks and the nasty fight between Democrats and Republicans over raising the government's debt ceiling could dampen employers' enthusiasm to hire new workers.</p>

<p>"Over the coming weeks I am going to be putting out more proposals, week by week that will help businesses hire and put people back to work," Obama told workers at a battery plant in Michigan. "I am going to keep at it until every single American who wants a job can find one."</p>

<p>Economists remain cautiously optimistic that the world's largest economy will avoid a double-dip recession, citing declining energy prices and the unwinding of supply chain disruptions from the earthquake in Japan.</p>

<p>U.S. exports fell for a second consecutive month, to $170.9 billion, as shipments to Canada,[doudoune north face femme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-femme-c-2.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-femme-c-2.html"), Mexico, Brazil, Central America,[バーバリーセール](http://www.burwe.com/ "http://www.burwe.com/"), France,[doudoune north face homme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html"), China and Japan all declined.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama on Thursday renewed a call for an extension of a payroll tax cut and pressed Congress to pass legislation that would increase investment in the nation's aging infrastructure and boost exports.</p>

<p>Imports from China rose nearly 5 percent to $34.4 billion, lifting the closely watched trade gap with that country to $26.7 billion, the highest in 10 months.</p>

<p>Prices for Treasury debt fell and the market suffered its worst long bond auction in 2-1/2 years. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies.</p>

<p>The government will release its second estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product on August 26\. The economy grew at a 0.4 percent rate in the first quarter.</p>

<p>"It is possible that the risk aversion manifested in financial markets will spill over to hiring. However, the data in hand don't yet reflect such a dynamic," said Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas in New York.</p>

<p>An increase in the volume of oil imports pushed the monthly oil import bill in June to its highest since August 2008\. That and the second straight month of declines in exports contributed to the month's wider trade deficit.</p>

<p>"The level of claims at this point is more consistent with at least no deterioration in labor market conditions and at best an economy that is adding jobs at about 200,000 (a month)."</p>

<p>The jobless claims data released by the Labor Department on Thursday eased concerns that the economy was heading back into recession,[バーバリー](http://www.burberryjp.net/ "http://www.burberryjp.net/"), as feared by investors,Related Theme Articles:

<p>For men,[ブランドバッグ](http://www.iburandos.org/ "http://www.iburandos.org/"), about 12 percent had worked in occupations listed as known lung cancer risks, compared to 6 percent of controls; these occupations included mining, metalworking,[バーバリーアウトレット](http://www.burberrywebs.org/ "http://www.burberrywebs.org/"), and certain types of construction work.</p>

<p>Men in the known to be risky occupations were 74 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with lung cancer. The strongest associations were seen for ceramic and pottery jobs and brick manufacturing, as well as for those working in manufacturing of non-iron metals.</p>

<p>While cigarettes are by far the most important cause of lung cancer, chemicals and other on-the-job hazards "play a remarkable role" in lung cancer risk, the researchers write in the American Journal of Epidemiology.</p>

<p>To provide updated information on these risks, they looked at the association between lung cancer and jobs either known or suspected to increase the risk of the disease in 2,100 people diagnosed with lung cancer and 2,120 healthy individuals matched by age, gender and residence.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Men who work in certain occupations continue to be at increased risk of lung cancer, new research from Italy shows.</p>

<p>Paulson has told investors that his team has spent a lot of time thinking about Europe and possible calamities that could occur there, including a Greek payment default.</p>

<p>Mevi, who oversees $11.9 billion in public pension money, said New Mexico had decided to cash out in part because of concerns that the manager's fund had become too large and could not easily get in and out of positions.</p>

<p>Another criticism is that Paulson is late trying to capitalize on bets that the crisis in the euro zone will mean hard times for the continent's banks and financial institutions.</p>

<p>In May, for the first time, he presented his "best ideas" at the Ira Sohn Investment Conference, a popular charity event attended by a number of well-known managers. But the idea Paulson presented was anything but new: He listed AngloGold Ashanti, a long-term holding, as one of his favorite picks.</p>

<p>"Going into the second half of 2012, he is well-positioned,[The North Face](http://www.toinf.com/ "http://www.toinf.com/")," Krusen said.</p>

<p>BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire trader John Paulson has told his wealthy investors that he has learned from his mistakes of 2011, which produced enormous losses for his closely watched hedge fund.</p>

<p>While Paulson still has loyal clients, some U.S. public pension funds and Wall Street firms that are invested with him have expressed their growing unease.</p>

<p>"He seems anxious to be shorting Europe, but he needs an event to succeed, such as a bank failure, but the European Central Bank and European Union officials have so far obviated that," said Peter Rup, CEO and chief investment officer at Artemis Wealth Advisors, which is not invested with Paulson.</p>

<p>He previously let his 2007 returns speak for him. That year, largely on the strength of the subprime trade, his credit fund surged 591 percent, and the Advantage Plus fund rose 163 percent.</p>

<p>"We don't have a formal watch list, but he is being watched more closely," Missouri's Yoakum said. "And we are certainly much more critical than we have been in the past."</p>

<p>MISTAKES WERE MADE</p>

<p>Investors have only a few chances to pull their money out of his various funds every year. To do so by the end of June,[Polo Ralph Lauren](http://www.ppoloralphlaurenfr.com/ "http://www.ppoloralphlaurenfr.com/"), they would have had to notify Paulson by mid-May, according to several smaller investors who said they had asked for their money back.</p>

<p>Investors have said Paulson has signaled that second-quarter redemptions will add up to the usual few percent of past quarters.</p>

<p>He told investors these stocks had helped performance from late May through early June, but for the year to date, two of his big holdings have not performed well. AngloGold Ashanti is down nearly 20 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, while Gold Fields Ltd's ADRs have fallen nearly 17 percent.</p>

<p>If Greece does default and exits the common currency, he said, European banks would be hit extremely hard.</p>

<p>UNDER PRESSURE</p>

<p>But if the numbers do not show improvement soon, industry analysts worry that confidence may weaken further, especially if other big clients like state pension funds begin to bolt.</p>

<p>There are signs that the pressure to deliver may be getting to the normally soft-spoken manager, who has long said that he and his partners put up more than half of his firm's capital.</p>

<p>One New York adviser to wealthy clients recently expressed surprise at how much time Paulson, one of the industry's busiest managers, had spent explaining his views on the world and investing to him. The adviser requested anonymity because his employer forbids him to speak to the media.</p>

<p>Known for his patient, or some might say stubborn,[doudoune north face femme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-femme-c-2.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-femme-c-2.html"), views,[ブランドバッグ](http://www.iburandos.org/ "http://www.iburandos.org/"), Paulson is sticking with gold stocks, saying they are undervalued compared with the price of the metal.</p>

<p>New Mexico, which stuck by Paulson through last year's growing losses, pulled its $40 million investment in the first quarter.</p>

<p>But as the months tick on,[doudoune north face homme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html"), many investors are still waiting to see the dramatic turnaround Paulson has vowed to deliver.</p>

<p>At least one Wall Street bank that raked in big fees selling access to Paulson's funds over the years is souring on him. The brokerage arm of Morgan Stanley put Paulson on a "watch list" early in the second quarter, instructing clients to avoid putting new money with him.</p>

<p>As they tweak the portfolio, Paulson and his team are spending a lot of time trying to persuade jittery investors to stick with him and newcomers to put money with him.</p>

<p>"It is fair to say that he is having a difficult year,[バーバリーアウトレット](http://www.burberrywebs.org/ "http://www.burberrywebs.org/")," said Steve Yoakum, executive director of the $30 billion Missouri Public Employee Retirement System, which is invested with him.</p>

<p>This has taken a huge bite out of the firm's assets, which have fallen to $22 billion from $38 billion early last year, according to investors. Redemptions were substantial, but poor performance accounted for the bulk of the drop, they said.</p>

<p>Halfway through 2012, Advantage Plus is down again, losing 10 percent through May. Another big portfolio that bets on gold - once a bright spot for Paulson - was also in the red. In both cases, he blamed losses in gold stocks for the declines.</p>

<p>Charles Krusen, chief executive officer of Krusen Capital Management, says he thinks Paulson has taken key steps to reposition the portfolio by hedging better and pulling back some of his positions.</p>

<p>To be sure, Merrill Lynch, UBS AG and other banks whose brokerage arms also offer access to Paulson funds have not taken similar steps.</p>

<p>Some analysts who study the $2 trillion hedge fund industry say Paulson may have miscalculated again this year.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment for this story.</p>

<p>Paulson has admitted to his investors that in 2011 he was overly optimistic about the speed of the U.S. recovery and underestimated the magnitude of Europe's debt crisis. He has called last year's performance "unacceptable" and said he was committed to delivering a "superior investment performance" in the future.</p>

# WHO warns of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity

<p>The United Nations data showed one in three adults worldwide has raised blood pressure - the cause of around half of all deaths from stroke and heart disease - and the condition affects almost half the adult population in some countries in Africa.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Health data released on Wednesday provided the clearest evidence to date of the spread of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease from developed nations to poorer regions such as Africa, as lifestyles and diets there change.</p>

<p>* Death registration:</p>

<p>- In 20 years, the number of maternal deaths has dropped from more than 540,000 in 1990 to less than 290,000 in 2010 - a decline of 47 percent. A third of these deaths were in just two countries - India with 20 percent of the global total,[doudoune north face homme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-homme-c-3.html"), and Nigeria with 14 percent.</p>

<p>But in Africa, more than 40 percent -- and in some places up to 50 percent - of adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure.</p>

<p>This report does not examine the causes behind the rising or falling numbers, but seeks to give a snapshot of major diseases and health risks affecting the global population.</p>

<p>While the average global prevalence of diabetes is around 10 percent, the report said, up to a third of the population in some Pacific Island countries have the condition.</p>

```

<p>In wealthy countries, widespread diagnosis and treatment with low- cost drugs have significantly reduced average blood pressure readings across populations - and this has contributed to a reduction in deaths from heart disease, the WHO said.</p>

<p>But the WHO says almost 80 percent of deaths from such diseases now occur in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Other key trends identified in the report include:</p>

<p>"Today, half a billion people - or 12 percent of the world's population - are considered obese,[バーバリー](http://www.burberryjp.net/ "http://www.burberryjp.net/")," said Ties Boerma, the WHO's director of health Statistics and information systems.</p>

<p>The highest obesity levels are in the Americas,[Polo Ralph Lauren](http://www.poiie.com/ "http://www.poiie.com/"), where 26 percent of adults are obese, and the lowest are in south east Asia, at 3 percent of adults.</p>

<p>* Child deaths:</p>

<p>- Data from 2000 to 2010 show the world has made significant progress in reducing child deaths, cutting them from almost 10 million under- fives in 2000 to 7.6 million in 2010\. Falls in numbers of deaths from diarrheal disease and measles have been particularly striking,[The North Face](http://www.toinf.com/ "http://www.toinf.com/"), the WHO said.</p>

<p>Obesity is another major issue, the WHO said, with data showing rates of obesity doubling in every region of the world between 1980 and 2008.</p>

<p>Most of these people remain undiagnosed, the report said, and yet many could be treated with inexpensive medicines - an intervention that would cut the risk of death and disability from heart disease and stroke.</p>

# Bladder control problems more common in ADHD

<p>He said that large studies are still needed both to pin down the incidence of bladder-control problems in children with ADHD, and to understand the underlying reasons. Medication side effects could be one factor, Palmer noted, but research is needed to confirm that.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be more likely than their peers to have problems with bedwetting and other bladder control symptoms, a new study finds.</p>

<p>"Parents should be aware that some of these children will have voiding issues," Palmer said.</p>

<p>The current findings, published in the Journal of Urology,[doudoune north face homme](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-
homme-c-3.html "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/the-north-face-
homme-c-3.html"), are based on questionnaires and symptom diaries given to the parents of 62 children with ADHD and 124 without the disorder who served as a "control" group.</p>

<p>When the researchers looked at the children's symptom diaries, 22 percent of the ADHD group had problems like bedwetting or urinary incontinence over three days. That compared with 5 percent of the control group.</p>

<p>For parents of kids diagnosed with ADHD, awareness is the bottom line, according to Palmer.</p>

<p>But the small size limits the conclusions that can be drawn,Related Theme Articles:

<li><http://buchha.com/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/161946><li> , said Dr. Lane S. Palmer, chief of pediatric urology at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York.</p>

<p>On average, children with ADHD scored an 11 on a questionnaire gauging urinary tract symptoms -- including bedwetting and habitually feeling an urgent need to urinate or to "hold" it in. In general, a score of nine or higher suggests bladder problems, according to the researchers.</p>

<p>In contrast, the average score in the ADHD-free group was a three.</p>

<p>Turkish researchers found that among 62 children with ADHD and 124 without the disorder, kids with ADHD scored considerably higher on a questionnaire on "voiding" symptoms -- problems emptying the bladder.</p>

<p>According to Palmer, treatment usually means various types of behavior changes -- like limiting liquids in the evening and having kids wear a programmable watch that reminds them to take bathroom breaks at regular intervals during the day.</p>

<p>It's not fully clear why that is. But it could have to do with the stimulant medications used to treat ADHD,[doudoune north face](http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/ "http://www.thenorthfaceenlignes.com/"), or with the disorder itself, according to Aydogdu,[バーバリー](http://www.burberryjp.net/ "http://www.burberryjp.net/"), of Ankara University School of Medicine in Turkey.</p>

<p>A pediatric urologist not involved in the study said that it "helps shed a little light" on the association between ADHD and urinary problems.</p>

<p>He added that some parents might think that voiding problems are "just a part" of ADHD. "But they should be aware that it can be addressed,[ブランドバッグ](http://www.iburandos.org/ "http://www.iburandos.org/")," he said.</p>

<p>In particular, they tended to have more problems with bedwetting and habitually feeling an urgent need to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p>It can be more difficult for kids with ADHD to make such changes compared with other children. So it's important to individualize children's therapy, Palmer said,Related Theme Articles:

<p>The new findings suggest that "the incidence of all voiding problems, not only enuresis, increases in children with ADHD,[Polo Ralph Lauren](http://www.poiie.com/ "http://www.poiie.com/")," Dr. Ozgu Aydogdu, one of the researchers on the study, told Reuters Health in an e-mail.</p>

<p>"With enough baby steps," Palmer said, "you'll get to the end."</p>

<p>Rates of ADHD vary widely by state, but up to 9.5 percent of U.S. children aged 4 to 17 - a total of 5.4 million kids in 2007 -- have been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Annual costs associated with the condition range from $12,000 to 17,000 per child.</p>

<p>Some past research has suggested that up to 30 percent of children with attention deficit disorders have had problems with wetting themselves, either during the day or while sleeping -- what doctors call enuresis.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. government agents investigating alleged steroid use among 10 Major League Baseball players went too far in seizing test results for hundreds of other people from a California lab and using them to expand the probe,[コーチ](http://www.jcoan.com/ "http://www.jcoan.com/"), an appeals court ruled on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit panel reversed a ruling by a smaller group of appellate judges which disapproved of the wholesale seizure of the records but allowed the government to use materials.</p>

<p>The appeals court affirmed lower court rulings that the evidence obtained through the too-expansive search should be suppressed as a violation of Fourth Amendment protections against illegal search and seizure.</p>
