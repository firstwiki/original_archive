## Team History

In 1995, the FIRST Robotics Competition was introduced to
[Dave_Lavery](http://www.firstwiki.net/index.php/Dave_Lavery
"http://www.firstwiki.net/index.php/Dave_Lavery" ) by a group of high school
students from South Lakes High School. In 1996, under the guidance of Dave
Lavery and Dave Miller, Team 116 competed as rookies. The team became the
first team in the Mid-Atlantic and the first NASA-base sponsored team, and
remains the NASA HQ team to this day. In 1999 the team moved from South Lakes
High School to Herndon High School due to a lack of administrative support.
South Lakes maintained a team for one more season, but due to Herndon
acquiring the NASA sponsorship, they acquired the team identity. Over the
years, Team 116 has used a variety of identities, ranging from "Aluminum
Weasels" to "RoboHobos" to the current name, Epsilon Delta.


### Animation History

Under the guidance of senior Lev Popov, the 116 animation team became highly
competitive in the 2003 season. 116 won it's first Autodesk Award for
Visualization at the Lone Star Regional in 2003. This success and the
continued hard work of the animation team lead the school to allow use of a
computer lab for network rendering. In 2004, under the leadership of Steven
Cohen and Tristian Goget, they were again rewarded with Autodesk Visualization
Awards from both the VCU Regional and the Chesapeake Regional. Again under the
leadership of Steven and Tristian 116 was able to win the Autodesk
Visualization award in the Cheasapeak Regional in 2005. This award came only
after a few problems
[[1]](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=345282
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=345282" )
[[2]](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=343964
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=343964" ). Under the
leadership of Phil Richardson and Stephen Becker in 2006, 116 won the VCU AVA,
but would see it's 5 regional "win streak" come to an end in Peachtree, where
1414 (iHOT) would win. In 2007 the team won the NASA/VCU AVA under the
leadership of Kit Parker. Kit once again led the team to the NASA/VCU AVA in
2008, and the team was nominated as a Championship AVA finalist for the first
time in 2008.


### Vex and FTC History

In 2005, Team 116's proposal to sponsor a Vex team in the FIRST Vex Challenge
pilot program was approved. And thus, FVC 18 was born. The team would perform
outstandingly well at the pilot event in Atlanta that spring. Finishing
qualification as the #5 seed, it was selected by FVC 27 into the #2 alliance.
FVC27, 18, and 48 would go on to win the FVC Pilot event. 18 would also be
nominees for two other awards, including the Vex Challenge Award (FVC
Chairmans). In 2006, the team would have another outstanding year, winning the
Connect and Amaze award's at the Duluth Vex Regional, as well as reaching the
regional finals as the #2 seed. For the 2006/07 season, FVC 18 was re-numbered
as FVC 116. In 2007/8, the team fielded two FTC teams. FTC 539 won the
Maryland FTC Championship in 2008, and qualified for the Championship event.
