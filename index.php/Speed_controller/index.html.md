# Speed controller

## From FIRSTwiki

A **speed controller** is a device that processes an input signal to control the speed of a [motor](motor). This is accomplished by controlling the voltage delivered to the motor.

## Speed Controller Design

Some low-current speed controllers use voltage regulator transistors to control the voltage delivered to the motor. High-current speed controllers like the [Victor](Victor "Victor") series use a series of gates arranged in an [H-bridge](/index.php?title=H-bridge&action=edit "H-bridge") to rapidly turn the power to the motor on and off. A [capacitor](/index.php?title=Capacitor&action=edit "Capacitor") "smooths" the on-off pattern into a constant current with a voltage lower than the supply voltage of the speed controller. The H-bridge design also allows the motor to be reversed and allows for the motor terminals to be shorted to "brake" the motor.

## Types/Brands of Speed Controllers

- The [Victors](Victor "Victor") used by [FIRST](first) take input in the form of [PWM](pwm).
