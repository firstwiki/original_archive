A **speed controller** is a device that processes an input signal to control
the speed of a [motor](/index.php/Motor "Motor" ). This is accomplished by
controlling the voltage delivered to the motor.

## Speed Controller Design

Some low-current speed controllers use voltage regulator transistors to
control the voltage delivered to the motor. High-current speed controllers
like the [Victor](/index.php/Victor "Victor" ) series use a series of gates
arranged in an [H-bridge](/index.php?title=H-bridge&action=edit "H-bridge" )
to rapidly turn the power to the motor on and off. A
[capacitor](/index.php?title=Capacitor&action=edit "Capacitor" ) "smooths" the
on-off pattern into a constant current with a voltage lower than the supply
voltage of the speed controller. The H-bridge design also allows the motor to
be reversed and allows for the motor terminals to be shorted to "brake" the
motor.

## Types/Brands of Speed Controllers

  * The [Victors](/index.php/Victor "Victor" ) used by [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) take input in the form of [PWM](/index.php/PWM "PWM" ).
