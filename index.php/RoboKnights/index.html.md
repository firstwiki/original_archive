interest, with many more trying for the team. The team has not won any awards
to date.

# Ocean Oddessy Events Attended

  * Wheeler High School Regional Tournament 

"Our experience was quite educational. We learned a lot in our rookie year and
even made it to state. We learned from the judges when they gave us some tips
and tricks on how to improve for next year on speaking and not interrupting!
Our coach Ms. Van Vliet was great. And although she couldn't help us, she gave
us the support we needed."

  * GA Tech State Tournament 

"We never expected to make to state in just our rookie year. It was
interesting, seeing other teams' displays and their problems. We didn't win
any awards or make it to the World Festival, but we learned and waited for
next year"
