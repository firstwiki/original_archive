## History

Team 1280 was founded in 2004 in San Ramon Valley High School. Since then the
team has received numerous awards and significantly improved its skill set. In
their rookie year the team won five awards at two different regionals. Their
first regional win was in 2007, at the Silicon Valley Regional.


## Team projects

The web development team is very strong and has several of its own interesting
projects.


### Scribe

[Project website](http://scribe.sourceforge.net
"http://scribe.sourceforge.net" ) Scribe is the
[CMS](/index.php?title=CMS&action=edit "CMS" ) that the 2006 website ran on.


### Kure

[Project website](http://kure.thespinn.com "http://kure.thespinn.com" ) Kure
is the blogging engine that was integrated into Scribe for the 2006 website.


### PQL

[Project website](http://pql.thespinn.com "http://pql.thespinn.com" ) PQL or
Portable Query Language is an effort to create the ultimate PHP based
relational database system. PQL is unique in that it is object-oriented and
stores data in a quick-to-access, flat-file format. Future incarnations of
Scribe and Kure will use PQL as their storage medium because of its technical
superiority.
