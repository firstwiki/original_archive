The language is pretty constant. I added pages for two major revisions to the control system. I'm not sure about the 1996 date, though. I'm pretty sure it was around before I started (in 1997). I'm also pretty sure it wasn't used all the way back to 1993, when they switched to radio control. So, I picked 1996, because that was right in the middle of the timespan. I'll continue doing research and change it when/if I find something correct. --[Sciencewhiz](User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz") 14:27, 16 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Were there actually 2 different controllers in 2000 and 20003? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" )

Is it fair to say the RC changes year to year? It was pretty stable, until of course it changed this year to use C. That was a major change, sure, but it should remain somewhat steady for a few years yet, with some minor improvments maybe, but overall I'd imagine, compatibility with this year's controller.

Yea, you're right. Who are you? (To sign, do 2 - , then 3 ~) --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 12:19, 29 May 2004 (EDT)
