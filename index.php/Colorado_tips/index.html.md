General Tips" )]

## General Tips

  * DRINK LOTS OF WATER!!! Dehydration is not fun and is very easy to get in such a dry climate. If you start to feel any of the symptoms of dehydration, (E.G. dizzyness, light-headedness, confusion, fainting, lack of sweat, swollen tounge, dry-mouth, digestion problems, or dark yellow urrine), take five, get to someplace cool, chug a bottle of water, and take it easy. Carrying around a water bottle is a good way to keep yourself hydrated. You want to stay on top of your game while you're here, so drink lots of water and you'll be fine. 
  * Parking is a 10 minute walk from the arena.

What to Pack" )]

## What to Pack

  * Because [weather](http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=DEN "http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=DEN" ) in Colorado shifts so quickly, it's highly recommended to prepare for any kind of weather, including blizzards, thunderstorms, heatwaves, and severe winds. And yes, they can all happen on the same weekend. You never know. The latest [weather forcast](http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=DEN "http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=DEN" ) is usually accurate within a few days, but keep in mind that anything can happen. 
  * Usually dressing in jeans and layers that you can add/take off depending on the weather is a good idea.

Where to Eat" )]

## Where to Eat

  * Outside food is not allowed in the arena, while they don't really have the staff to enforce this, it is discouraged. Overpriced vendors open at 9-10, so eat a big breakfast before comming. Food is an 8 minute walk with a [Subway], [Black Jack's], bagel shop, and others nearby.
