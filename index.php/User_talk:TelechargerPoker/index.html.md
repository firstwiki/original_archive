Online poker casinos have sophisticated security systems which enable its
personnel to look at the hand-history of a particular player. This is not
possible in a land-based casino where players simply fold their hands and no
one can find out the strength of their hand. Online poker security-men can
also detect the IP of a player and prevent multiple players to play from the
same house. They can also prevent players from playing at known proxy servers.
So in online poker, you are in safe hands - another reason why more players
are choosing to play [telecharger poker](http://www.pokerenfrancais.eu

). Online poker can also give you a ticket to playing real-life poker
tournaments. It is often a part of promotion by online casinos to bring new
players into the arena. Online poker is a mind game as well. Unlike in land-
based poker rooms where you could judge the reactions and body language,
online poker is based purely on your own skills and mastery over the craft.
That makes the winning money even sweeter because you have earned it by skills
that you have acquired, not by pure chance or by the mistakes of others.
