"Fisher Price" )  
Stall current (amps) |  64  
Stall torque (in-lb) |  5.72  
Max power output (watts) |  390  
Free speed (rpm) |  16000  
  
  
Two Fisher Price (FP) motors and gearboxes are included with every [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ). The FP is the second most
powerful motor in the kit of parts. The FP is taken from a Powerwheels (tm)
car where it powers one of the wheels.

## Included gearbox

The included gearbox is the same one that is used in the Powerwheels (tm) car.
It has a ratio of approximately 188:1. The gearbox uses plastic gears, but it
is relatively reliable and not known to strip gears. It has a non-standard
output shaft consisting of a open-ended cylinder with 10 slots cut into it. It
mates with a spool-shaped piece with spokes matching the slots.

## Torque and Efficiency curves

    
    
                   the torque of the fp motor is .45 N-m at stall

### Without gearbox

    
    
          .45 N-m

### With gearbox

## Usage Notes

The Fisher Price has by far the highest power density of any of the KoP
motors.

The 2005 KoP included a Fisher Price motor designed to operate at 9 volts,
instead of 12. Consequently, it is very easy to burn out because it creates
such large amounts of heat in such small volume/mass. Be sure to design a
mechanism using a Fisher Price so that the motor never approaches the stall
torque. A good rule of thumb is to design for 1/4 the stall torque.
