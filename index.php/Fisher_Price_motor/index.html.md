## Fisher Price

[![Fisher Price](/media/7/74/MotorpicFP.jpg)](Image:MotorpicFP.jpg "Fisher Price")<br>
Stall current (amps) | 64<br>
Stall torque (in-lb) | 5.72<br>
Max power output (watts) | 390<br>
Free speed (rpm) | 16000

Two Fisher Price (FP) motors and gearboxes are included with every [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts"). The FP is the second most powerful motor in the kit of parts. The FP is taken from a Powerwheels (tm) car where it powers one of the wheels.

## Included gearbox

The included gearbox is the same one that is used in the Powerwheels (tm) car. It has a ratio of approximately 188:1\. The gearbox uses plastic gears, but it is relatively reliable and not known to strip gears. It has a non-standard output shaft consisting of a open-ended cylinder with 10 slots cut into it. It mates with a spool-shaped piece with spokes matching the slots.

## Torque and Efficiency curves

```
               the torque of the fp motor is .45 N-m at stall

## Usage Notes

The Fisher Price has by far the highest power density of any of the KoP motors.

The 2005 KoP included a Fisher Price motor designed to operate at 9 volts, instead of 12\. Consequently, it is very easy to burn out because it creates such large amounts of heat in such small volume/mass. Be sure to design a mechanism using a Fisher Price so that the motor never approaches the stall torque. A good rule of thumb is to design for 1/4 the stall torque.
