##  History

* * *

**2006** Team 1747, Harrison Boiler Robotics, was founded in the spring of 2005. A science biology teacher and several students worked through the summer and early school year to obtain school approval and funding. Many obstacles had to be overcome, mainly issues with support from the local school corporation. 

The nucleus of the team came from a nearby team where they had spent several
years already on a FIRST robotics team. This team was [461](461
"461" ). Along with these more experienced students, the help of other local
FIRST teams, and a college support program through Purdue University for FIRST
teams in the area, a team was pulled together.

Because FIRST was not on the Secondary School Principal List of Approved
Activities, the team and teacher sponsors had to use unexcused absences on
trips to competitions. Currently, 1747 is working with the organization to put
FIRST on the list.

In addition to this hurdle, the school corporation refused any school
computers to be used by the team.

Nonetheless, the team persevered and built the team's first robot, The Spirit
of Luke, and an award-winning animation. Winning the Rookie All-Star award at
the Boilermaker Regional, 1747 traveled to Atlanta.

During the summer after 1747's rookie year, the team was shortly disbanded due
to leadership issues. Upon restructuring, the team competed at an off season
the Indiana Robotics Invitational and won the Spirit of Indiana award.

**2007** The team went under new leadership for the 2007 season. Due to restrictions in their own high school, the team worked in Team [1646](1646 "1646" )'s workshop. Thanks to [1646](1646 "1646" )'s generosity, Harrison Boiler Robotics was able to build a competitive robot, named "Sebastian". 

Participating in the St. Louis Regional and the Boilermaker Regional,
"Sebastian" produced many points for the team, even reaching the final round
of competition at the Boilermaker Regional. Notable events during the build
season include a week-long blizzard which threatened the production of the
robot. The severe snowstorm resulted in a week of missed school and a half-
week of missed robotics meetings. Luckily, students and mentors were still
able to make it to school to finish the robot in time.
