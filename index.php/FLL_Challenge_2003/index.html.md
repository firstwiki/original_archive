The [FLL Challenge](/index.php/FLL_Challenge "FLL Challenge" ) theme for 2003
was Mission Mars. FLL teams were tasked to compete in the Robot Game, as well
complete a Project to design a robotic expedition to answer a key question
about Mars exploration.

The challenge was released in September, 2003 with the bulk of Official State
tournaments occuring in December. The season was concluded by the [FLL
Invitational](/index.php/FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival" ) (now known
as the FLL World Festival) which was held in conjunction with the FIRST
Championship event in April 2004.

## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of
Lego on it related to that year's theme. Examples included: MAV Launcher
Launch; Habitation Modules Construction; Tetrahedron Base Deployment; etc.
These were all missions that might need to be done on Mars as part of research
about Mars or human habitation/settlement on Mars. In the robot game, a robot
designed by the team and built entirely from Lego Mindstorms kits and Lego
pieces had to autonomously complete the missions on the board. Each mission
had a specific point value.
