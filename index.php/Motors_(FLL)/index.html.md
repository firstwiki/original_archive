# Motors (FLL)

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

There are two kit sets that are currently allowed for FLL - the older Lego
Mindstorms Kit, and the new Mindstorms NXT kit. See [FLL Robot
Set](/index.php/FLL_Robot_Set "FLL Robot Set" ) for details on this. Both are
electric motors driven by power from either the older Mindstorms or newer NXT
"brick".

# Mindstorms NXT Motors

The [Electric Motor NXT](http://peeron.com/inv/parts/53787
"http://peeron.com/inv/parts/53787" ) is the motor that comes with the newer
Mindstorms NXT.

Old Mindstorms Motors" )]

# Old Mindstorms Motors

Either the [Electric Technic Mini-Motor
9v](http://peeron.com/inv/parts/71427c01
"http://peeron.com/inv/parts/71427c01" ) (or possibly the [lighter
version](http://peeron.com/inv/parts/43362c01
"http://peeron.com/inv/parts/43362c01" ) included on more recent sets).


# Parts limitations

A maximum of three of these electric motors can be used on an FLL competition
robot. See [FLL Allowable Parts](/index.php/FLL_Allowable_Parts "FLL Allowable
Parts" ) for more information on what your competition robot can contain.

A wealth of detail on other electric technic motors, as well as weight,
stalled performance, etc. can be found on [Philo's Technic 9V Motor
page](http://www.philohome.com/motors/motorcomp.htm
"http://www.philohome.com/motors/motorcomp.htm" ). But remember only the above
motors are legal for FLL robots! Not all the motors on Philo's page are legal
for FLL bots.


## Other

[Wind-up and Pull-back motors](/index.php?title=Wind-up_and_Pull-
back_motors&action=edit "Wind-up and Pull-back motors" ) are also allowed and
may provide an alternative to electric motors. Since these are not electric
parts they do not count against the limitations on how many electric motors a
robot can have.
