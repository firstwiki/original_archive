## Info

The [The Robotic Eagles (358)](358 "358"), I was the only student programmer on my team for two of the three years I was a student on the team. I started programming in sixth grade (1999) in Borland Turbo C++ by looking through several books that my mom had from when she went to college. Later on I went into website programming, where I learned basic HTML. I continued my journey into high school when I started learning BASIC programming language, ASP for websites and javascript. In tenth grade I stated to learn ASM and a lot of operating system information, and started to learn PHP. I continued to learn PHP and everything about the internet and operating systems in eleventh grade and started to learn java. I am currently attending college at the State University of New York at Binghamton majoring in Computer Science. My current non-FIRST / non-School projects (yes there are other things besides FIRST), are [phpMaid](http://phpmaid.com/ "http://phpmaid.com/"), which is an open source CMS for webmasters to use for their websites to save time and money, and my operating system (which has no name), and it is currently planned to be for x86-64 processors, and hopefully I will migrate it to PowerPC processors after I make it well enough.
