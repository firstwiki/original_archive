MOE?" )]

## What is MOE?

MOE is one of FIRST's "legacy teams". They have a very unique image from their
bright green shirts, to their MOE cheer, and their apperent love of dance.
They are also unique in their team is not made up from students from one
particular school, like some other teams, which are basiced in a school. Based
in Wilmington, Delaware, each year students flock to DuPont Bairley Mill Plaza
from over fifteen different schools from Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland and
New Jersey.

Started in 2000, MOE evolved from a DuPont Explorer Post program. In fact, the
name 'MOE', or Miracle of Engineering, derives from DuPont's slogan "Miracles
of Science". Ever since then, all the students and mentors have enjoyed
participating in US FIRST competitions.

Usually creating high-tech robots, which makes working on them fun, but also
gives us great opportunities for fixing them! Our very first year, we placed
seventh overall in the nation, and in our second year, we were part of the
Championship Alliance! However, most of all we have been proud of our robots
no matter how they ranked in the competitions.

## Sponsors

MOE relies heavily on the support of our sponsers. They are the ones that
feed, clothe, and give MOE a home and place to work. At MOE, the students
write a thank you letter to each of our sponsors - thanking them for their
gifts of support over the years. They are also listed on the web site, along
with their logo and link to their public page.


### Dupont

DuPont is by far our biggest sponsor. Most of the MOE mentors are DuPont
employees in a varridy of engineering, and non-engineering fields.

  * DuPont Engineering
