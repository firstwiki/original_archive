The **Operator Interface**, or **OI** is the unit of the [control system](Control_system "Control system") that collects [input](Input "Input") controlled by the human [operator](Operator "Operator") and transmits it to the [Robot Controller](robot-controller).

In the past, the OI communicated with the RC using either a [radio modem](Radio_modem "Radio modem") or [tethered connection](Tether "Tether"). The OI inputs data from 4 [ports](/index.php?title=Ports&action=edit "Ports"). It also transmited data out of the [DASHBOARD port](/index.php?title=DASHBOARD_port&action=edit "DASHBOARD port").

The control system uses a team number identification system to ensure proper communication during matches. In the past, teams set their team number into the OI using dipswitches. As of 2010, team numbers are set via inputting the number into the operator interface computer.

In general, the OI stays relatively the same from year to year. However, typically the Robot Controller and Operator Interface of the same year must be used together. To learn more about the different versions, see their respective pages.
