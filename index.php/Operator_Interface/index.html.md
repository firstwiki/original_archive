The **Operator Interface**, or **OI** is the unit of the [control
system](Control_system "Control system" ) that collects
[input](Input "Input" ) controlled by the human
[operator](Operator "Operator" ) and transmits it to the [Robot
Controller](robot-controller).

In the past, the OI communicated with the RC using either a [radio
modem](Radio_modem "Radio modem" ) or [tethered
connection](Tether "Tether" ). The OI inputs data from 4
[ports](/index.php?title=Ports&action=edit "Ports" ). It also transmited data
out of the [DASHBOARD port](/index.php?title=DASHBOARD_port&action=edit
"DASHBOARD port" ).

The control system uses a team number identification system to ensure proper
communication during matches. In the past, teams set their team number into
the OI using dipswitches. As of 2010, team numbers are set via inputting the
number into the operator interface computer.

In general, the OI stays relatively the same from year to year. However,
typically the Robot Controller and Operator Interface of the same year must be
used together. To learn more about the different versions, see their
respective pages.
