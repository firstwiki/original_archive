A **sensor** is a device that detects, or _senses_, the surrounding
environment. In terms of robotics, and specifically [FIRST](FIRST
"FIRST" ), sensors enable the [robot](Robot "Robot" ) to better
understand what is around it and how to react. The types of sensors used in
FIRST are electrical, meaning that they send signals to the [Robot
Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ) that is then
converted into some value for use by the program. There are two main types of
sensors, [analog](Analog "Analog" ) and
[digital](Digital "Digital" ). An analog sensor, such as a
[potentiometer](Potentiometer "Potentiometer" ), will have a value
in the range of 0 to 1023 (10 bits). A digital sensor, such as a [limit
switch](Limit_switch "Limit switch" ), is much more limited, only
having _off_ and _on_ states, represented by 0 and 1.

Sensors are important aspects of [programming](Programming
"Programming" ), allowing truly complex robots that can react intelligently to
dynamic situations. The use of advanced sensors is often necessary to devlop
an effective [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ),
though many other uses are possible. Sensors can count the number of rotations
of a particular wheel and then the program can adjust speed based on this
information; sensors can determine whether some apendage is fully extended,
and then shut off power to a motor; sensors can allow the robot to avoid
objects that the robot [operator](Operator "Operator" ) might not
see.

The sensors included in the [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of
parts" ) are:

  * [IR sensor](IR_sensor "IR sensor" )
  * [Banner sensor](/index.php?title=Banner_sensor&action=edit "Banner sensor" )
  * [Gyroscope](Gyroscope "Gyroscope" )
  * [Current sensor](Current_sensor "Current sensor" )
  * [Pressure sensor](Pressure_switch "Pressure switch" )
  * [Accelerometer](Accelerometer "Accelerometer" )
  * A vision system, currently the [CMUcam2](CMUcam2 "CMUcam2" ). 

See [electronics rules](/index.php?title=Electronics_rules&action=edit
"Electronics rules" ) for information on where and which sensors may be
bought, and the price limit on them.
