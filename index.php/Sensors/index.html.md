A **sensor** is a device that detects, or _senses_, the surrounding environment. In terms of robotics, and specifically [FIRST](first), sensors enable the [robot](Robot "Robot") to better understand what is around it and how to react. The types of sensors used in FIRST are electrical, meaning that they send signals to the [Robot Controller](robot-controller) that is then converted into some value for use by the program. There are two main types of sensors, <analog> and <digital>. An analog sensor, such as a [potentiometer](Potentiometer "Potentiometer"), will have a value in the range of 0 to 1023 (10 bits). A digital sensor, such as a [limit switch](Limit_switch "Limit switch"), is much more limited, only having _off_ and _on_ states, represented by 0 and 1.

Sensors are important aspects of [programming](Programming "Programming"), allowing truly complex robots that can react intelligently to dynamic situations. The use of advanced sensors is often necessary to devlop an effective [autonomous mode](autonomous-mode), though many other uses are possible. Sensors can count the number of rotations of a particular wheel and then the program can adjust speed based on this information; sensors can determine whether some apendage is fully extended, and then shut off power to a motor; sensors can allow the robot to avoid objects that the robot [operator](Operator "Operator") might not see.

The sensors included in the [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of
parts") are:

- [IR sensor](IR_sensor "IR sensor")
- [Banner sensor](/index.php?title=Banner_sensor&action=edit "Banner sensor")
- [Gyroscope](Gyroscope "Gyroscope")
- [Current sensor](Current_sensor "Current sensor")
- [Pressure sensor](Pressure_switch "Pressure switch")
- [Accelerometer](Accelerometer "Accelerometer")
- A vision system, currently the [CMUcam2](CMUcam2 "CMUcam2").

See [electronics rules](/index.php?title=Electronics_rules&action=edit "Electronics rules") for information on where and which sensors may be bought, and the price limit on them.
