# Veteran teams

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Veteran teams are teams that have previously participated in a FRC game (i.e. not [Rookie Teams](/index.php?title=Rookie_Teams&action=edit "Rookie Teams")). There's some question as to what constitutes a veteran team versus a rookie team; some teams (i.e. [1727](1727 "1727")) started with rookie status, even though they had a veteran coach.
