A joystick is the standard human input device for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition"). It consists of a stick mounted to a base that can be tilted left and right and occasionally twisted (varies per model). These movements are sensed by potentiometers. Joysticks occasionally have buttons or other potentiometers for the user to use and manipulate.

## Connection to Operator Interface

Over the years, there have been many different methods of connecting a joystick to the [operator interface](Operator_Interface "Operator
Interface").

### USB Connector

After 2009 with the introduction of the National Instruments [robot controller](robot-controller), a joystick's USB cable connects a joystick to the [operator interface](operator-interface) through any of several USB ports. Many joysticks and game controllers are available to use because of the new operator interface released in 2009 and 2010.

Before 2009, the [USB Chicklet](USB_chicklet "USB chicklet") was introduced in 2007 to allow teams to use most USB game controllers, especially the XBox 360 controller.

### 15-Pin Connector

Before 2008, a 15-pin cable connected a joystick to any one of the ports labeled "PORT 1" through "PORT 4" on the [operator interface](operator-interface). Up to four joysticks could be connected to the operator interface. Today, very few joysticks are still being manufactured with the 15-pin connector, and even less of those still support the gameport standard which is required for its use with the operator interface. To guarantee that a new joystick supports the gameport standard, make sure it supports both DOS and Windows 3.1.

### Other Joysticks

Teams can purchase other joysticks, or make their own control devices and joysticks. The possibilities are endless with the post-2009 operator interface.

## Kit of Parts Joysticks

The CH Flightstick is a basic joystick with X and Y analog axes as well as a wheel to control the Z-axis. The stick has both a top and a trigger button. The AVB Topshot joystick is a slightly more advanced joystick with 4 buttons as well as a "hat switch" replacing the wheel to control the Z-axis.
