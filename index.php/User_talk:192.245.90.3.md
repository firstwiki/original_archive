It appears your contributions to Scouting, Spirit, and [Team
management](/index.php/Team_management "Team management" ) are basically
advertisements for "FIRST NEMO (non-engineering Mentor Organization)". If this
is relevant, please do put it on the page, but do not put the same content on
3 pages that is purely information about NEMO, not what the page is about.
FIRSTwiki is not a public bulletin board for advertiements.
