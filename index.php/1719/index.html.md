## History

Team 1719, The Umbrella Corporation, evolved from the Engineering and Robotics
team of The Park School into Team 1719, "The Umbrella Corporation," in the
spring of 2005. Plans continued through the spring and summer of 2005. Work
proceeded to prepare the space, raise funds, attract mentors, and organize the
program. The administration gave approval to accepting outside students onto
the team, thus expanding Park's program and providing an opportunity to
students who otherwise would not be able to participate in FIRST. This
ultimately led to the team accepting a number of students from a new magnet
program, The Science and Math Academy of Aberdeen High School, or SMA. In
recognition of the valued membership of these students, SMA was listed as an
affiliate school when the team officially registered with FIRST in October
2005.

During the fall of 2005, students attended seminars on various elements of
robot design, toured robotics facilities, and learned C programming in
anticipation of the skills needed for the build season. In March, the team
took its new robot to the much-anticipated Chesapeake Regional, and came away
with the highest Award a rookie team could win, the Rookie All-Star Award.
Afterwards, the team attended the Philadelphia Regional and won the Rookie
Inspiration Award. The Rookie All-Star Award earned the team a berth at The
National Championships in Atlanta. Team 1719 also started a FIRST Lego League
program at The Park School. Several team members help with mentoring.

The team was forced to rebuild itself after the 2006 season, as almost half
the team members and almost all the engineering mentors decided to form Team
[1980](/index.php/1980 "1980" ) at SMA. However, the team was again priveleged
to receive a NASA grant and several other generous sponsorships from various
organizations (listed below). The team submitted a proclamation to Governor
O'Malley's office. This proclamation recognized FIRST as an important and
influential national program. The full text along with more details can be
found on [Maryland FIRST Robotics Day](/index.php/Maryland_FIRST_Robotics_Day
"Maryland FIRST Robotics Day" ) page. At the Chesapeake Regional Competition,
the team received the [Imagery Award](/index.php/Imagery_Award "Imagery Award"
), and was later selected for an alliance with Teams [1975](/index.php/1975
"1975" ) and [175](/index.php/175 "175" ).
