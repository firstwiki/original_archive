# Drivers

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Each team can designate two drivers during any given match at a competition as
part of the team's [drive team](/index.php?title=Drive_team&action=edit "Drive
team" ). These drivers are responsible for controlling the robot and its
mechanisms, and are the only drive team members allowed to touch the robot
[control panel](/index.php?title=Control_panel&action=edit "Control panel" ).
Drivers must be pre-college team members (generally meaning high school
students).

Generally, the task of driving a robot is split between the two drivers by
having one operate the base (movement along the ground) and the other operate
the scoring mechanism. This is not always the case, however; it is up to each
team to decide how to control their robot.
