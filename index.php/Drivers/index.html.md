# Drivers

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Each team can designate two drivers during any given match at a competition as part of the team's [drive team](/index.php?title=Drive_team&action=edit "Drive
team"). These drivers are responsible for controlling the robot and its mechanisms, and are the only drive team members allowed to touch the robot [control panel](/index.php?title=Control_panel&action=edit "Control panel"). Drivers must be pre-college team members (generally meaning high school students).

Generally, the task of driving a robot is split between the two drivers by having one operate the base (movement along the ground) and the other operate the scoring mechanism. This is not always the case, however; it is up to each team to decide how to control their robot.
