Mission" )]

## Our Mission

Our mission is not only to build a robot, but also to promote science and
technology. In the spirit of FIRST, we are a multidisciplinary team and strive
to shine a positive light on engineering and all learning. We encourage
students to join in real life leadership, science, business and technology
challenges. Our team is not confined to one classroom, nor one school and not
even one city. We draw our strengths from the entire Near North area. This
encompasses North Bay, Ontario, Canada and communities within an hour’s drive.
We strive to draw in a variety of individuals, including teachers, parents,
business owners and young students who have not yet entered high school.

Robot" )]

## This Years Robot

This year’s robot, Duke, was released to the cheers of sponsors and alumni
February 17, 2011.

This year’s robot Duke consists of a rectangular aluminum frame and a 2 speed,
6 wheel drive system driven by CIM motors with AndyMark Supershifters
transmissions. An arm and claw design is used to pick up and score inner
tubes. The arm uses a fisher-price motor with a sprocket reduction and spring
counter weights to lift. It uses a pneumatic cylinder to extend and retract an
extension arm to keep inside the allowed dimensions. The claw features 2
vertical pegs and a fitted rotating top side scoop to grip the tubes with no
need to grab the underneath of the tubes. The claw is driven by a window
motor. Duke will compete at the FRC Waterloo Regional March 24-26 and at the
FRC Greater Toronto Regional March 31-April 2. Our team has also qualified to
attend the FIRST World Championships in St Louis, Missouri, April 27 – 30th
where Duke will compete against some of the best FRC robots in the world!

Welcome to St. Joseph-Scollard Hall Catholic Secondary School. As a school
community we take tremendous pride in offering our students a learning
environment that focuses on the intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual
development of the child.

Our goal is to nurture a personal relationship with Jesus that will inspire
Catholic leadership. We are dedicated to excellence in education and we strive
to make our school a home away from home for our students. We endeavour to
foster a school culture in which students are happy and where they develop
positive self-esteem in a safe and nurturing environment. Our programming
includes growth opportunities outside the classroom in athletics, music,
drama, clubs and in coming together to address social justice issues.

We are committed to promoting a school-wide focus on literacy and are
constantly looking for ways to improve our students’ ability to read, write,
comprehend and communicate effectively. Together, our school community seeks
opportunities for meaningful learning experiences in mathematics, the
humanities, science, the arts, in business and technology, in physical
education, languages and religious education.

The St. Joseph-Scollard Hall Bears take to the field, the court, or the ice
knowing that whatever the outcome they will win with humility and lose with
pride. In striving to act justly, love tenderly and walk humbly with God they
represent, for all of us, our daily goal to grow in the discipleship to which
each one of us has been called.

the situation: a merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states,
or organizations. It is also a name that can be French or English, a unique
characteristic of French Immersion students. The Alligator was chosen by the
students. How fitting, too, that it is a bilingual word. Once again, the
school colors were chosen by the students for the students. For this reason,
the students of ALLIANCE PUBLIC SCHOOL were given the opportunity to gain true
ownership in their new Immersion Centre.
