## Our Mission

Our mission is not only to build a robot, but also to promote science and technology. In the spirit of FIRST, we are a multidisciplinary team and strive to shine a positive light on engineering and all learning. We encourage students to join in real life leadership, science, business and technology challenges. Our team is not confined to one classroom, nor one school and not even one city. We draw our strengths from the entire Near North area. This encompasses North Bay, Ontario, Canada and communities within an hour's drive. We strive to draw in a variety of individuals, including teachers, parents, business owners and young students who have not yet entered high school.

## This Years Robot

This year's robot, Duke, was released to the cheers of sponsors and alumni February 17, 2011.

This year's robot Duke consists of a rectangular aluminum frame and a 2 speed, 6 wheel drive system driven by CIM motors with AndyMark Supershifters transmissions. An arm and claw design is used to pick up and score inner tubes. The arm uses a fisher-price motor with a sprocket reduction and spring counter weights to lift. It uses a pneumatic cylinder to extend and retract an extension arm to keep inside the allowed dimensions. The claw features 2 vertical pegs and a fitted rotating top side scoop to grip the tubes with no need to grab the underneath of the tubes. The claw is driven by a window motor. Duke will compete at the FRC Waterloo Regional March 24-26 and at the FRC Greater Toronto Regional March 31-April 2\. Our team has also qualified to attend the FIRST World Championships in St Louis, Missouri, April 27 – 30th where Duke will compete against some of the best FRC robots in the world!

Welcome to St. Joseph-Scollard Hall Catholic Secondary School. As a school community we take tremendous pride in offering our students a learning environment that focuses on the intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual development of the child.

Our goal is to nurture a personal relationship with Jesus that will inspire Catholic leadership. We are dedicated to excellence in education and we strive to make our school a home away from home for our students. We endeavour to foster a school culture in which students are happy and where they develop positive self-esteem in a safe and nurturing environment. Our programming includes growth opportunities outside the classroom in athletics, music, drama, clubs and in coming together to address social justice issues.

We are committed to promoting a school-wide focus on literacy and are constantly looking for ways to improve our students' ability to read, write, comprehend and communicate effectively. Together, our school community seeks opportunities for meaningful learning experiences in mathematics, the humanities, science, the arts, in business and technology, in physical education, languages and religious education.

The St. Joseph-Scollard Hall Bears take to the field, the court, or the ice knowing that whatever the outcome they will win with humility and lose with pride. In striving to act justly, love tenderly and walk humbly with God they represent, for all of us, our daily goal to grow in the discipleship to which each one of us has been called.

**Alliance Public School**

The name Alliance was chosen since the definition of the word best represented the situation: a merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states, or organizations. It is also a name that can be French or English, a unique characteristic of French Immersion students. The Alligator was chosen by the students. How fitting, too, that it is a bilingual word. Once again, the school colors were chosen by the students for the students. For this reason, the students of ALLIANCE PUBLIC SCHOOL were given the opportunity to gain true ownership in their new Immersion Centre.

We are now in Year 2 of existence and Alliance is now the biggest elementary school in the district. We boast a very experienced staff who are committed to quality education. The many activities and sports programs that are offered also make Alliance the "place to be".
