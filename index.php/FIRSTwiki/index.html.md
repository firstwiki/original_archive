**FIRSTwiki** ([www.firstwiki.net](http://www.firstwiki.net/ "http://www.firstwiki.net/")) is an open content encyclopedia of all things related to [FIRST](first). It is a _wiki_ (see [What is a Wiki?](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ#What_is_a_Wiki.3F "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ")), or website where anyone is able to edit almost any page. FIRSTwiki strives to serve the [FIRST community](first-community) by providing useful content and a historical record that will serve all participants of the FIRST Robotics Program.

FIRSTwiki was created on **May 24, 2004**. It uses the [MediaWiki](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_page "metawikipedia:Main_page") software (currently version [1.4beta5](Special:Version "Special:Version")). It was created and is currently managed by [Max](User:Max "User:Max"). Other [administrators](FIRSTwiki:Administrators "FIRSTwiki:Administrators") help too, -- but contributors from all over the community are the main force of the project. FIRSTwiki was created in response to a [thread on ChiefDelphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28697 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28697") where [Phrontist](User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist") suggested a FIRST wiki.

FIRSTwiki is currently hosted by the [ChiefDelphi](chiefdelphi) web forums, thanks to [Brandon Martus](Brandon_Martus "Brandon Martus"). FIRSTwiki also has its own sub-section on the ChiefDelphi forums (see [[1]](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=134 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=134")).
