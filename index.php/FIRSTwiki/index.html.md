**FIRSTwiki** ([www.firstwiki.net](http://www.firstwiki.net/ "http://www.firstwiki.net/" )) is an open content encyclopedia of all things related to [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). It is a _wiki_ (see [What is a Wiki?](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ#What_is_a_Wiki.3F "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Overview_FAQ" )), or website where anyone is able to edit almost any page. FIRSTwiki strives to serve the [FIRST community](/index.php/FIRST_community "FIRST community" ) by providing useful content and a historical record that will serve all participants of the FIRST Robotics Program. 

FIRSTwiki was created on **May 24, 2004**. It uses the
[MediaWiki](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_page "metawikipedia:Main_page"
) software (currently version [1.4beta5](/index.php/Special:Version
"Special:Version" )). It was created and is currently managed by
[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ). Other
[administrators](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Administrators
"FIRSTwiki:Administrators" ) help too, -- but contributors from all over the
community are the main force of the project. FIRSTwiki was created in response
to a [thread on
ChiefDelphi](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28697
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28697" ) where
[Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) suggested a FIRST
wiki.

FIRSTwiki is currently hosted by the [ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi
"ChiefDelphi" ) web forums, thanks to [Brandon
Martus](/index.php/Brandon_Martus "Brandon Martus" ). FIRSTwiki also has its
own sub-section on the ChiefDelphi forums (see
[[1]](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=134
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=134" )).
