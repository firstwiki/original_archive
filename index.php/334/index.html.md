## Team 334 History

From the time it opened its doors in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, NY, Brooklyn
Technical High School has maintained a reputation synonymous with the word
“engineering.” Dr. Albert Colston, an engineer and educator, whose innovative
vision sought to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of the time,
founded Brooklyn Tech in 1922. Dr. Colston himself wrote the curriculum that
has been used to this day as the foundation for Brooklyn Tech’s engineering
course instruction.

Almost a century later, Brooklyn Tech continues Colston’s vision of
maintaining an environment for progressive engineering education as part of
the school’s mission. Currently, the school offers Media Communications,
Computer Science, and Genetics in addition to the traditional disciplines of
Mechanical, Electrical and Civil Engineering.

Inspired by the school’s legacy, eighteen Tech seniors formed a team and
entered their first robotics competition in 1999 as “Team 334: The Tech
Engineers.” The competition, sponsored by US FIRST Robotics, had little
representation from inner-city New York teams. Regardless, Team 334 went on to
win the "Rookie of the Year" as well as the "Featherweight Robot" Awards and
placed second at the Philadelphia Regional Competition. These original members
personified the spirit of FIRST and Brooklyn Technical High School: to solve
real-world problems by creating, designing, and applying engineering concepts.
The school followed suit in Fall 2000 by introducing Robotics to Brooklyn
Tech's curriculum as an elective, fostering Dr. Colston’s original objectives.

From its humble beginnings, the Robotics team now has over 60 members in seven
team divisions: mechanical, electrical and pneumatics, design, programming,
public relations, and operations. All of these divisions correspond to the
majors that Brooklyn Tech offers, giving everyone the opportunity to
participate and contribute. Team 334 has mentored six rookie teams since 2001
as well as opened its workshops to other teams. Also, Team 334 has volunteered
at the New York City Regional and Lego League Competition since 2001. Over the
years, Team 334 has been recognized by FIRST for its spirit and contributions
to the FIRST community, including being honored with the President's Award
(2002), the Chairman's Award (2003), the Engineering Inspiration Award (2004,
2005, &amp; 2007), and the Johnson &amp; Johnson Sportsmanship Award (2006).
These awards are manifestations of what it really means to be an engineer and
a proud FIRST Robotics team member.

Eight years after those eighteen students founded Team 334, their interest in
engineering has affected Brooklyn Technical High School in an unimaginable
way. Robotics has evolved from an extracurricular activity into part of the
school's core technology curriculum, with nearly 100 sophomores studying
Robotics as a class each year. Future prospects may include the creation of a
new technology major with robotics as its focal point within the next two
years.

  

Outside of Tech, Team 334 continues its efforts to increase interaction
between NYC teams. Stay tuned for more info about the Brooklyn Alliance, an
attempt to unite all of the teams in Brooklyn and create a community for
mentoring and assistance, on and off the field.


## Shop Squad

Many members of the robotics team, as well as others have founded an extra-
curricular organization named Shop Squad. They help achieve the needs of the
school, including the renovation of rooms, rewiring electrical system, and
many other tasks. Their biggest projects were the adaptation of the Brooklyn
Tech foundry into a storage space, located on the 7th Floor North side, and
their current project of turning 3N3 to a fully functioning machine shop.
Members of shop squad learn many life skills, including carpentry, electrical
wiring, machining, and advanced demolition techniques. They also spend time
over the summer doing various tasks, most notably moving over 40 retired
lathes from the 2nd floor to 3N3, not only allowing for 2 new lab rooms, but
also for the revival of expensive, and previously written off technology.
Overall, Shop Squad does its best to save the school money and to preserve the
rich history of Brooklyn Tech. Whenever something needs to be done,
administration knows where to find them.
