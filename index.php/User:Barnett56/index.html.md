## First Look-Louis Vuitton Damier Rivington

I got an email last week of a PurseBlog reader looking for a sneak peek at an upcoming Louis Vuitton bag. Lea asked and we can deliver! Welcome the **Louis Vuitton Damier Rivington** which is said to be available starting August 1st.

You know why I love this bag? There is a large shoulder drop and a seemingly good sized body with the sturdy Louis Vuitton Damier Canvas. The Damier canvas is a favorite of mine. It works well with many outfits,[cheap louis vuitton](http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/ "http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/"), seasons, and years. Keep your eyes out for more from Louis Vuitton items hitting stores this summer! Approximate price will be $1030\. Shop via Louis Vuitton online.

## A closer look at Louis Vuitton Spring 2012

Of all the Spring 2012 collections, all the pastels and brights and florals, it's hard to name any one line that more thoroughly captured the light, airy idealization of the season quite like Louis Vuitton. The runway show show practically floated on its own, filled with white broderie anglais and crocodile bags in the palest shades of blue and yellow imaginable. We've covered the collection's most notable pieces, from the light-as-a-feather Monogram Transparence to the lavishly expensive Crocodile Old Speedy Flap,[cheap authentic louis vuitton handbags](http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/scarves-

handbags-c-113_128_3_31_32.html"), but the rest of the collection yields some gems as well.

And thus, we bring you the rest of the **Louis Vuitton Fall 2012 Collection**. From leather-trimmed satchels in pale monogramed canvas to a few of the controversial basket bags we saw on the runway, this collection has a little bit of something for everyone. Personally, count me in for the bicolor **Louis Vuitton Speedy North South**, please. Check out all of the bags after the jump.

## Louis Vuitton Hair Cubes Strass

While you are reading this, I'll be sitting on an airplane with a numb arse eating my peanuts and wondering how much longer the 9 hour flight will be. You can instead enjoy the comfort of your home/office/wherever and admire this set of two hair cubes. Ah yes. The **Louis Vuitton Hair Cubes Strass** is proving to us that hair scrunchies and hair ties are soo HOT! You can choose from a set of Pink/blue or Brown/beige. I bet this is what you all have been dreaming about. Lucky us, they are finally here. Unfortunately, I will not be buying these. These cubes remind me of the car dice that hang from the rear view window- and that is a bad thing,[cheap louis vuitton belts for men](http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/scarves-handbags-c-113_128_3_31_32.html "http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/scarves-handbags-c-113_128_3_31_32.html")! Right now there is no word on the pricing- but if you really want to inquire just call your local LV boutique or check them out online. Actually when I think about it again, these could possibly be pulled off by some girls (or guys <img class="wp-smiley" title="Louis Vuitton Hair Cubes Strass" alt="Louis Vuitton Hair Cubes Strass icon smile" src="/> ), but I'm not sure if I can see that person being me.

## Louis Vuitton Wapity Case

I want a Wapity!!!! Last night I was spending some much needed time on the lovely Purse Forum and ran into some posts about the Wapity and got my mind completely and totally set on it. I am so set on it, that I have been imagining how well it will work for when I go out. The **Louis Vuitton Wapity Case** is made with the Monogram canvas with natural cowhide trim and is accented with golden brass hardware. Perfectly for nights on the town, there is a natural wrist strap with yellow topstitching and a golden LV rivet. I have been looking for the perfect accessory for a night out dancing,[discount authentic louis vuitton handbags](http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/scarves-
handbags-c-113_128_3_31_32.html "http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/scarves-
handbags-c-113_128_3_31_32.html"), would this be it?? The interior has a patch pocket and raspberry alcantara lining. Overall the Wapity, which is my new favorite word to say, measures 4.3″ x 3″ x 1.7″. Someone please tell me you have this and let me know if it can hold the necessities I need to have with me at all times (pics would be ohh so helpful)!!!! Buy it via eLuxury for $255.

## Louis Vuitton Card Deck Set

Folks,[cheap louis vuitton shoes for women](http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/shoes-c-102.html "http://www.louisvuittonbetter.com/shoes-c-102.html"), we've done it. I think. Maybe I'm being optimistic. But, with the advent of the **Louis Vuitton Card Deck Set**, I think it may be possible for someone with enough money and enough dedication to go through their entire day without deigning to use a product that's not luxury branded. We've covered Chanel and Hermes bicycles, Gucci makes wallpaper, Fendi makes bedding, Versace makes furniture. And now, your husband won't just be playing poker with the guys, he'll be playing **Louis Vuitton** poker. And that won't get him made fun of by his buddies AT ALL, I promise.

Eluxury promises that this set includes three "luxurious" decks of cards, so please, help me brainstorm in the comments - exactly how does one make playing cards luxurious? The first thing that came to my mind was having the symbols ever so carefully covered in close-cropped mink, making them slightly furry. How would you do it? Buy through eLuxury for $105.
