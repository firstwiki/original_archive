I reoganized a few of the links so that the page templates are a bit more
promenent then the page creation templates. Hopefully people will actually see
the formats now and use them on thier team pages.

## Robot Page Format?

After creating the page for 172's robot "Falgor" (["Falgor"
(172)](/index.php/%22Falgor%22_%28172%29 ""Falgor" \(172\)" ), I noticed that
User Cbale added a "format needed" template to the page almost immediately.
That template redirected me here, and I planned on reformatting the page to
suit the layout conventions for a robot page...but I found that no such format
exists. All of the randomly selected robot pages I have viewed contain the
same formatting template, and I cannot find what they are supposed to look
like. Is there a standard in place, or does one need to be created? Thanks.

  * Please see [FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Yearly_team_page_format "FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format" ) for use on ["Falgor" (172)](/index.php/%22Falgor%22_%28172%29 ""Falgor" \(172\)" ). --[Nlaverdure](/index.php/User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 13:42, 4 January 2008 (EST) 
  * Ah, okay, thanks. Since "Falgor" is a unique case, where a single robot name represents multiple years of robots, would it be appropriate to manipulate that basic form, using only applicable sections (and adding sub sections to represent each year)? There are a number of sections there that would either fall incomplete or irrelevant if I were to copy it as is. Thanks again. --[KPWM](/index.php/User:KPWM "User:KPWM" ) 14:22, 4 January 2008 (EST) 
  *     * You probably should split up the Falgor article and create [172 in 2007](/index.php?title=172_in_2007&action=edit "172 in 2007" ), [172 in 2006](/index.php?title=172_in_2006&action=edit "172 in 2006" ), [172 in 2005](/index.php?title=172_in_2005&action=edit "172 in 2005" ), etc as other teams have done ([1885 in 2007](/index.php/1885_in_2007 "1885 in 2007" ) is a good example). [FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Yearly_team_page_format "FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format" ) explains how to do this. --[Nlaverdure](/index.php/User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 15:30, 4 January 2008 (EST) 
  *     * You could also create a page something the the extent of like [Falgor 172 in 2007](/index.php?title=Falgor_172_in_2007&action=edit "Falgor 172 in 2007" ) or [172 in 2007 Falgor](/index.php?title=172_in_2007_Falgor&action=edit "172 in 2007 Falgor" ). That way you still represent the name in the title even though the year changes. As [Nlaverdure](/index.php/User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) correctly assumed, the "needformat" tag was to split the page into separate year articles, it makes pages much less confusing and allows more space to talk about an individual year, as opposed to a huge group of many years. Had this been regular Wikipedia, I probably would have found a split page tag for it instead. Sorry for the confusion. I'll probably go in and add a split article tag later to prevent any similar issues that might happen with other articles in the future.

The standard is [172 in 2007](/index.php?title=172_in_2007&action=edit "172 in
2007" ). You can insert the template as described (ie, {{subst:format/year}}).
There were a lot of pages already there when the standard was created which
have not been updated to reflect it.
