I reoganized a few of the links so that the page templates are a bit more promenent then the page creation templates. Hopefully people will actually see the formats now and use them on thier team pages. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000") 11:40, 19 September 2007 (EDT)

## Robot Page Format?

After creating the page for 172's robot "Falgor" (["Falgor" (172)](%22Falgor%22_%28172%29 ""Falgor" \(172\)"), I noticed that User Cbale added a "format needed" template to the page almost immediately. That template redirected me here, and I planned on reformatting the page to suit the layout conventions for a robot page...but I found that no such format exists. All of the randomly selected robot pages I have viewed contain the same formatting template, and I cannot find what they are supposed to look like. Is there a standard in place, or does one need to be created? Thanks. --[KPWM](User:KPWM "User:KPWM") 13:30, 4 January 2008 (EST)

- Please see [FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format](FIRSTwiki:Yearly_team_page_format "FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format") for use on ["Falgor" (172)](%22Falgor%22_%28172%29 ""Falgor" \(172\)"). --[Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure") 13:42, 4 January 2008 (EST)
- Ah, okay, thanks. Since "Falgor" is a unique case, where a single robot name represents multiple years of robots, would it be appropriate to manipulate that basic form, using only applicable sections (and adding sub sections to represent each year)? There are a number of sections there that would either fall incomplete or irrelevant if I were to copy it as is. Thanks again. --[KPWM](User:KPWM "User:KPWM") 14:22, 4 January 2008 (EST)
- - You probably should split up the Falgor article and create [172 in 2007](/index.php?title=172_in_2007&action=edit "172 in 2007"), [172 in 2006](/index.php?title=172_in_2006&action=edit "172 in 2006"), [172 in 2005](/index.php?title=172_in_2005&action=edit "172 in 2005"), etc as other teams have done ([1885 in 2007](1885_in_2007 "1885 in 2007") is a good example). [FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format](FIRSTwiki:Yearly_team_page_format "FIRSTwiki:Yearly team page format") explains how to do this. --[Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure") 15:30, 4 January 2008 (EST)

- - You could also create a page something the the extent of like [Falgor 172 in 2007](/index.php?title=Falgor_172_in_2007&action=edit "Falgor 172 in 2007") or [172 in 2007 Falgor](/index.php?title=172_in_2007_Falgor&action=edit "172 in 2007 Falgor"). That way you still represent the name in the title even though the year changes. As [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure") correctly assumed, the "needformat" tag was to split the page into separate year articles, it makes pages much less confusing and allows more space to talk about an individual year, as opposed to a huge group of many years. Had this been regular Wikipedia, I probably would have found a split page tag for it instead. Sorry for the confusion. I'll probably go in and add a split article tag later to prevent any similar issues that might happen with other articles in the future.

The standard is [172 in 2007](/index.php?title=172_in_2007&action=edit "172 in
2007"). You can insert the template as described (ie, {{subst:format/year}}). There were a lot of pages already there when the standard was created which have not been updated to reflect it. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 22:02, 4 January 2008 (EST)
