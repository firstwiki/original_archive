Hey everyone, my name is Samuel Crisanto, and I am the Director of Safety for
the Stuyvesant Robotics Team this year. Robotics is an incredibly fun thing to
do, and I encourage everyone reading this to go get involved. If you don't
have a team at your school, start one. You will learn a tremendous amount of
useful things, and meet lots of great people. It takes dedication and hard
work, but its very worth it.

  
as an aside, WE WON THE SAFETY AWARD AT THE NEW YORK CITY REGIONALS!

    
    
                                                            Be Safe!
