You can start any page you want to, but it doesn't mean it'll stay started.
[FIRSTwiki](/index.php/FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki" ) strives for an objective
[NPOV](/index.php?title=Wikipeida:NPOV&action=edit "Wikipeida:NPOV" ) (Nutural
Point Of View) style of articles. And I don't think Paul Schmidt deserves own
article. (And definately not under the name given), nor is there any objective
information in there. And welcome to FIRSTwiki!
