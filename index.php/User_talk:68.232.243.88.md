You can start any page you want to, but it doesn't mean it'll stay started. [FIRSTwiki](FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki") strives for an objective [NPOV](/index.php?title=Wikipeida:NPOV&action=edit "Wikipeida:NPOV") (Nutural Point Of View) style of articles. And I don't think Paul Schmidt deserves own article. (And definately not under the name given), nor is there any objective information in there. And welcome to FIRSTwiki! --[[User:Astronouth7303|[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") ([1227](1227 "1227"))]] 20:26, 18 Jan 2005 (EST)
