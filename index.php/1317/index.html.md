## History

Team 1317 met as a team for the first time on September 12, 2003\. There were a total of 13 members, 12 boys and 1 girl. Now, in the forth season, the team has increased to 17 members, 12 mentors, and much experience under the belt. Team 1317 is composed of home-schooled students, which leads to a unique collection of people. Because the team isn't affiliated with a particular school, it draw members from five counties in Ohio. Despite the physical separation, the shared love of engineering, technology, and FIRST motivated students to willingly make the trek to a centralized location each year for the FIRST build season.

During the pre-season, most of the meetings are held in a room provided by the Westerville Electric Division. During the build season, and site is provided by Continental Realty. Visitors to the site are often surprised to see everyone wearing coats indoors during the coldest days, as the building is heated only by space heaters, which cannot always keep up with the cold temperatures outside.

The team isn't just about the students. All of the team member's parents are directly involved in the success of Digital Fusion. The parents act as professional mentors by contributing their talents in engineering, fund raising, creative design, computer skills, and administration. The parents and siblings also support the team with their unquenchable team spirit. This involvement leads to close, permanent relationships springing up between families, and lifelong friendships between team members.
