Team 1317 was created for the purpose of providing the opportunity for
homeschooled high school students in the Central Ohio are to learn robotics
technology and its applications. Intensive academic challenge, high-level
student interest, and expanded career exploration were some of the key factors
compelling our tremendously enthusiastic participants.

## History

Team 1317 met as a team for the first time on September 12, 2003. There were a
total of 13 members, 12 boys and 1 girl. Now, in the forth season, the team
has increased to 17 members, 12 mentors, and much experience under the belt.
Team 1317 is composed of home-schooled students, which leads to a unique
collection of people. Because the team isn't affiliated with a particular
school, it draw members from five counties in Ohio. Despite the physical
separation, the shared love of engineering, technology, and FIRST motivated
students to willingly make the trek to a centralized location each year for
the FIRST build season.

During the pre-season, most of the meetings are held in a room provided by the
Westerville Electric Division. During the build season, and site is provided
by Continental Realty. Visitors to the site are often surprised to see
everyone wearing coats indoors during the coldest days, as the building is
heated only by space heaters, which cannot always keep up with the cold
temperatures outside.

The team isn't just about the students. All of the team member's parents are
directly involved in the success of Digital Fusion. The parents act as
professional mentors by contributing their talents in engineering, fund
raising, creative design, computer skills, and administration. The parents and
siblings also support the team with their unquenchable team spirit. This
involvement leads to close, permanent relationships springing up between
families, and lifelong friendships between team members.
