## History

Aces High, Team 176, was founded thirteen years ago when two engineers from
Hamilton Sundstrand in Windsor Locks Connecticut proposed starting a FIRST
team at Windsor Locks High School. Over the next ten years, the team added
students for neighboring Suffield High School and won the FIRST National
Championship in 1999. We typically compete in three official FIRST
competitions and as many off-season events run by other teams. Aces High also
hosts each years United Technologies Corporation Scrimmage designed to allow
local FIRST teams who have just completed their robots to test them. The
scrimmage is also used each year by the FIRST organization to test their new
playing field design.

During the fall semester the team participates in team building exercises and
fund raising events in preparation for the competition season beginning the
following January. This year Aces High consists of 42 students and
approximately 25 adults, with the students taking on more responsibilities
than in recent years. We hope to continue this trend as we continue into our
second decade.


## Team projects

The FIRST robotics competition is an event conducted by the FIRST Foundation
to promote interest in science and technology in pre-secondary school
students. The FIRST Foundation was organized in 1991 and is headquartered in
Manchester New Hampshire. The robotics competition brings together high school
students and professional engineers from companies and corporations from
across the United States, Canada, Europe and South America. Since engineers
are not certified educators, the primary goal of the program is to inspire
students through exposure to the engineering process and professional
engineers rather than attempting to teach engineering principles. Students
inspired in the process typically seek information from the engineers or the
science and technology teachers at their school.

The FIRST robotics competition consists of a six week robot "design / build"
phase starting in early January and ending mid February. The WLHS / SHS team
competes in regional competitions in March and April. These competitions are
intense three day events filled with high spirited competition, bands,
cheerleaders, strategy sessions and scouting reports.

Each year's game is different and is not revealed to the teams until the
January kickoff meeting. The robot is driven in competition by a "drive team"
consisting of two students with a third student (the "human player")
interacting with the robot. A coach is also part of the "drive team" and helps
the students plan and execute their game strategy.
