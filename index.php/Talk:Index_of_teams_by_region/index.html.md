Dang Nlaverdure, you did in a day what would have taken me weeks! What did you
do? write a script to fill in the blanks or something?? Well whatever the
case, good job and thanks for saving me a LOT of time.

  * Made a web scraper using MS Excel and some custom macros. Pulled the data from the FIRST team info database at [https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&amp;team=x](https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=x "https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=teaminfo&team=x" ), where x is the team number. Glad to know that I saved you some work. I can upload the file somewhere if you want to take a look. If I have time, I'll modify it to grab the team names from this site.

    * Sounds cool, I'd love to take a look at it. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 11:32, 1 November 2007 (EDT) 
      * Ok, I posted it to [[1]](http://nate.laverdure.googlepages.com/team_locations.xls "http://nate.laverdure.googlepages.com/team_locations.xls" ). None of the code is documented-- sorry. [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 13:07, 1 November 2007 (EDT)
