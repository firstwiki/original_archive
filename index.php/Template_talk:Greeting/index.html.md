##  Variable Arguments

I see that it works when you set name to a constant, like "newbie." But does
it also work with "varibables" like $user? --SilverStar

    I'm not exactly sure what you mean by a "variable". You can't run interpreted PHP code in it, if that's what you mean. It seems to have a bit of trouble with parameters in wikitax, see [template:teamtabletest](Template:Teamtabletest "Template:Teamtabletest" ) and its use on [FIRSTwiki:sandbox](FIRSTwiki:Sandbox "FIRSTwiki:Sandbox" ). --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 14:44, 11 Jun 2004 (EDT)
