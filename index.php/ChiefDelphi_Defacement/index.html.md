On February 8, 2005 (with 13 days left in the build season) the [ChiefDelphi](ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi") forums, the primary communication medium of the FIRST community, was defaced. The front page was replaced with a defacement tag in what appears to be broken English and Portuguese. The Portuguese translates to "A hug for the people of gigachat".
