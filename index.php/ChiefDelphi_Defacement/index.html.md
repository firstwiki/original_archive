On February 8, 2005 (with 13 days left in the build season) the
[ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" ) forums, the primary
communication medium of the FIRST community, was defaced. The front page was
replaced with a defacement tag in what appears to be broken English and
Portuguese. The Portuguese translates to "A hug for the people of gigachat".
