## History

We are Team HYPER. HYPER stands for "Helping Youth Pursue Engineering and
Robotics." We believe that statement defines our team's purpose. As a team, we
represent the students and staff of the North Quincy and Quincy High Schools,
professionals from Gillette, and volunteers from our community.

Team HYPER represents the city of Quincy (pronounced Quin-ZEE), Massachusetts.
Our team members could not be a more diverse group from the two high schools,
Gillette, and our community. On this site you can browse through the
chronicles of all our long hours spent working on this project. Our wide
variety of tasks bring us to realize that only team work can make this happen.

The FIRST competition exists as a way of raising awareness of science and
technology in students. Each school system is paired up with a corporate or
academic sponsor from the local community. The goal is to inspire students
through the building of a robot that participates in the local and national
competitions established and run by the FIRST organization.
