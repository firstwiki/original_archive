The rookie year in teamtoc must be a simple year! Pick either 2000 or 2002!

It is used to generate a category name. ([Category:Rookie
2000](/index.php/Category:Rookie_2000 "Category:Rookie 2000" ) or
[Category:Rookie 2002](/index.php/Category:Rookie_2002 "Category:Rookie 2002"
).) You can't have this big "2000 (465) 2002 (862)" thing.
