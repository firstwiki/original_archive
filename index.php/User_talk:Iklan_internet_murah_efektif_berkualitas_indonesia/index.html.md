berkualitas-indonesia" ) Monta Vista Robotics was established by a few friends
looking for a way to adventure into the the technological world through
creative innovation.

Over the last fourteen years, MVRT has taken great strides in technology and
leadership by encouraging its members to further pursue their imaginations
beyond the mundane world and into the extraordinary realm. However, none of
the achievements and advancements in technology would have been gained without
the continuous and unfailing support of our community, parents, and the more
than valuable guidance of our advisors and alumni. They have assisted us in
overcoming obstacles along the path for original and unique ideas.

MVRT continues to fulfill its mission in creating the "visionaries of
tomorrow" today by participating in FIRST and inspiring young students through
mentoring and community outreach. We stand together as a diverse group of
people ready to face hardships and difficulties and combine our ingenuity to
attain a common goal: building a masterpiece and inspiring the next generation
of engineers and leaders.
