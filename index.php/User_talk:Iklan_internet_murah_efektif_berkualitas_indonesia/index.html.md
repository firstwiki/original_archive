Founded in 1997, the Monta Vista Robotics FIRST Team #115 this information by

"https://sites.google.com/site/distro42x/home/iklan-internet-murah-efektif-
berkualitas-indonesia" ) Monta Vista Robotics was established by a few friends
looking for a way to adventure into the the technological world through
creative innovation.

Over the last fourteen years, MVRT has taken great strides in technology and
leadership by encouraging its members to further pursue their imaginations
beyond the mundane world and into the extraordinary realm. However, none of
the achievements and advancements in technology would have been gained without
the continuous and unfailing support of our community, parents, and the more
than valuable guidance of our advisors and alumni. They have assisted us in
overcoming obstacles along the path for original and unique ideas.

MVRT continues to fulfill its mission in creating the "visionaries of
tomorrow" today by participating in FIRST and inspiring young students through
mentoring and community outreach. We stand together as a diverse group of
people ready to face hardships and difficulties and combine our ingenuity to
attain a common goal: building a masterpiece and inspiring the next generation
of engineers and leaders.

Mission Statement

Dedicated to fostering a passion in science and technology within our
community, the Monta Vista Robotics Team inspires students and develops
interpersonal skills through team-based engineering challenges.

  
The team goals are:

    
    
       To create an environment that promotes sharing of knowledge, skills and experience.
       To respect opinions of others as well as ourselves despite differences.
       To create a friendly and professional environment.
       To work towards an operating structure to ensure a solid team.
       To promote the vision of FIRST in the community.
       To ensure equal opportunity for all.
