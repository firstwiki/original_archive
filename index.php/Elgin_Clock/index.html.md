### _The Bench_

The winds breath makes the trees sway to one side  
The way Elgin reads the FIRST Robotics rules on the park bench in Watertown  
is like the way a clould passes in the sky.  
Five minutes pass and a girl sits at the bench,  
"Do you like my clock?" Elgin says in excitment as he whips out his letherman,  
The girl ran away.  
She ran as if it was the end of the world.  
Elgin sipped tea in dissapointment as he thought about FIRST Robotics  
The sound of chuckles from kids in the background  
Makes Elgin hound  
His heart pounds fast  
And doesnt want it to last  
Its the bench in Watertown that makes Elgin smile  
As he sits with Kyle  
"What are you working on Elgin" As Kyle Love sips his soda in excitment  
"Why Kyle, I am designing stuff on Solid Works" He said in enlightment  
Dont dont change my design!  
It was just fine!  
Bharat im kicking you off team 25!  
Here is a high five!  
The Bench is what makes Elgin think of new ideas for every day life  
Like what he will eat for dinner  
Or will he be a sinner?  
If he'll go bike riding?  
Or summer hill sliding?  
Will he hang out with Mike Dez?  
Or will he have a Pez?  
Will he snort when he hangs out with Court?  
He thinks to himself,  
Is Arefins last name Bari?  
Or is it Larry?  
The day past slowly as Elgin sits on the small riggied bench in Watertown  
There is not a sound  
For yet he is all alone  
And he wants to go home.  
He wants to go home to the sweet smell of grilled cheese  
He always says please.  
"Can I have a sharpie Corey?"  
"Did you just call me Tory?" Corey responded in anger.  
"I only have five million Sharpies left,if i give one to you it will be
4,999,999,  
I am not wasting them."  
As Elgin starts cry,  
Corey give him a nice hug and walks away  
He walks away to the bay.  
Elgin sits on the bench in dismay?  
Thinking to himself about the sharpie why coudn't he just pay?  
The Bench is Elgin.  
Elgin is the Bench.  
Elgin thinks more as he sits quietly on the Bench in Watertown.  
He thinks to himself  
Is Henry from 222?  
Because they have a flippin sweet drive crew  
Is it Drew?  
Or is it lou?  
Can I hang out with Genia from 461  
I will call her hun.  
Lisa Perez is cool  
I want to go swimming in a pool.  
The Bench in Watertown is what makes Elgin so smart  
I want to buy some Clinque makeup  
Some one just told me to shut up.

### _The Christmas Bench_

Its back to the Bench in ye old Watertown.  
For Elgin is humming the sounds to Billy Holiday.  
"Whats that you say?" Little Susie asks in confusion.  
"Nothing! Im dreaming of a bay. Now run away!" Elgin scaresly tells the girl.  
He sits in confusion dreaming of Santa.  
No you silly goose  
Not of Santa.  
Of how he wants to be just like Santa.  
Making little children's dreams come true.  
And how he just doesnt want to be blue.  
Christmas is all that Elgin thinks about.  
It just makes him want to shout.  
Yell like hes never yelled before.  
Sing, like hes never sung before.  
As he lays next to Corey, what a bore!  
All Corey wants is to be like al gore.  
The Bench is where Elgin thinks about Christmas.  
Watching kids make snow angles is what makes Elgin want to be Santa.  
The Bench is what makes Elgin think about what he wants to give.  
I think Laura wants a pony.  
And names it Tony!  
Corey wants a poem from Court.  
So he can snort.  
Jake wants hooker heels.  
So he can put them on his pet seals.  
Ten minutes pass as a young lady sits next to Elgin on the Bench.  
"Im Santa. Dont worry your are not on the Naugty list." Elgin says in
excitment.  
The girl ran away.  
She ran through the biggest blizzard that Watertown has ever had.  
And she ran scared.  
As if she even cared.  
I am Santa.  
The three words that makes Elgin chuckle in his sleep.  
Does Kelly from 111 want a marshmellow peep?  
Does Kevin Shaw want a cheerleading uniform?  
And he wants to wear it in the storm?  
And Kyle Love, Kyle wants a iceicle.  
Not a tricicle!  
These are the things Elgin thinks of during Christmas time on the Bench in ye
old Watertown.  
For when it snows,  
He wears clothes.  
The clothes of Santa.  
"Why are your dressed like Santa?" Scott Shaw asks.  
Well Scott, because i can-ah."  
Well, i think i want to stir up a stew.  
For Drew.  
The Bench is what puts Elgin in the Christmas mood.  
I think I want some food.
