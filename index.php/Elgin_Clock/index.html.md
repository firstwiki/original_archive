## The Bench

_The Bench_ is a series of poems written by [CourtneyB](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=7008 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/member.php?u=7008") on [ChiefDelphi](chiefdelphi) about Elgin Clock. These poems may be considered [FIRST Humor](FIRST_humor "FIRST humor") for two reasons; first, they have many inside jokes known only to those in FIRST, in addition to the many references to famous FIRSTers.

"The Christmas Bench" was released exactly 8 months later on [ChiefDelphi](chiefdelphi) on November, 19, 2006.

### _The Bench_

The winds breath makes the trees sway to one side<br>
The way Elgin reads the FIRST Robotics rules on the park bench in Watertown<br>
is like the way a clould passes in the sky.<br>
Five minutes pass and a girl sits at the bench,<br>
"Do you like my clock?" Elgin says in excitment as he whips out his letherman,<br>
The girl ran away.<br>
She ran as if it was the end of the world.<br>
Elgin sipped tea in dissapointment as he thought about FIRST Robotics<br>
The sound of chuckles from kids in the background<br>
Makes Elgin hound<br>
His heart pounds fast<br>
And doesnt want it to last<br>
Its the bench in Watertown that makes Elgin smile<br>
As he sits with Kyle<br>
"What are you working on Elgin" As Kyle Love sips his soda in excitment<br>
"Why Kyle, I am designing stuff on Solid Works" He said in enlightment<br>
Dont dont change my design!<br>
It was just fine!<br>
Bharat im kicking you off team 25!<br>
Here is a high five!<br>
The Bench is what makes Elgin think of new ideas for every day life<br>
Like what he will eat for dinner<br>
Or will he be a sinner?<br>
If he'll go bike riding?<br>
Or summer hill sliding?<br>
Will he hang out with Mike Dez?<br>
Or will he have a Pez?<br>
Will he snort when he hangs out with Court?<br>
He thinks to himself,<br>
Is Arefins last name Bari?<br>
Or is it Larry?<br>
The day past slowly as Elgin sits on the small riggied bench in Watertown<br>
There is not a sound<br>
For yet he is all alone<br>
And he wants to go home.<br>
He wants to go home to the sweet smell of grilled cheese<br>
He always says please.<br>
"Can I have a sharpie Corey?"<br>
"Did you just call me Tory?" Corey responded in anger.<br>
"I only have five million Sharpies left,if i give one to you it will be 4,999,999,<br>
I am not wasting them."<br>
As Elgin starts cry,<br>
Corey give him a nice hug and walks away<br>
He walks away to the bay.<br>
Elgin sits on the bench in dismay?<br>
Thinking to himself about the sharpie why coudn't he just pay?<br>
The Bench is Elgin.<br>
Elgin is the Bench.<br>
Elgin thinks more as he sits quietly on the Bench in Watertown.<br>
He thinks to himself<br>
Is Henry from 222?<br>
Because they have a flippin sweet drive crew<br>
Is it Drew?<br>
Or is it lou?<br>
Can I hang out with Genia from 461<br>
I will call her hun.<br>
Lisa Perez is cool<br>
I want to go swimming in a pool.<br>
The Bench in Watertown is what makes Elgin so smart<br>
I want to buy some Clinque makeup<br>
Some one just told me to shut up.

### _The Christmas Bench_

Its back to the Bench in ye old Watertown.<br>
For Elgin is humming the sounds to Billy Holiday.<br>
"Whats that you say?" Little Susie asks in confusion.<br>
"Nothing! Im dreaming of a bay. Now run away!" Elgin scaresly tells the girl.<br>
He sits in confusion dreaming of Santa.<br>
No you silly goose<br>
Not of Santa.<br>
Of how he wants to be just like Santa.<br>
Making little children's dreams come true.<br>
And how he just doesnt want to be blue.<br>
Christmas is all that Elgin thinks about.<br>
It just makes him want to shout.<br>
Yell like hes never yelled before.<br>
Sing, like hes never sung before.<br>
As he lays next to Corey, what a bore!<br>
All Corey wants is to be like al gore.<br>
The Bench is where Elgin thinks about Christmas.<br>
Watching kids make snow angles is what makes Elgin want to be Santa.<br>
The Bench is what makes Elgin think about what he wants to give.<br>
I think Laura wants a pony.<br>
And names it Tony!<br>
Corey wants a poem from Court.<br>
So he can snort.<br>
Jake wants hooker heels.<br>
So he can put them on his pet seals.<br>
Ten minutes pass as a young lady sits next to Elgin on the Bench.<br>
"Im Santa. Dont worry your are not on the Naugty list." Elgin says in excitment.<br>
The girl ran away.<br>
She ran through the biggest blizzard that Watertown has ever had.<br>
And she ran scared.<br>
As if she even cared.<br>
I am Santa.<br>
The three words that makes Elgin chuckle in his sleep.<br>
Does Kelly from 111 want a marshmellow peep?<br>
Does Kevin Shaw want a cheerleading uniform?<br>
And he wants to wear it in the storm?<br>
And Kyle Love, Kyle wants a iceicle.<br>
Not a tricicle!<br>
These are the things Elgin thinks of during Christmas time on the Bench in ye old Watertown.<br>
For when it snows,<br>
He wears clothes.<br>
The clothes of Santa.<br>
"Why are your dressed like Santa?" Scott Shaw asks.<br>
Well Scott, because i can-ah."<br>
Well, i think i want to stir up a stew.<br>
For Drew.<br>
The Bench is what puts Elgin in the Christmas mood.<br>
I think I want some food.
