# Talk:Index of people

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Is the goal of this page to index _everyone_ involved in FIRST (the change to
"are part of" the community suggests this)? --[Max](User:Max

    The more people that are documented, the more people that are recognized.--[SilverStar](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 19:39, 27 May 2004 (EDT) 

    I agree, but maybe that means there should be two seperate lists, a total one, and a smaller one limited to "important" people. People that FIRSTwiki users are likely to look for, like the first dozen or so added to the list (Dean Kamen, Woody Flowers, etc.) --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:18, 30 May 2004 (EDT) 

Should there seperate user and people pages?

I think a good discussion about what this page intends to be is in order. I
don't think it is feasible *or* productive to index all the people invovled in
FIRST, or even all the mentors. Individual team pages seem to be taking care
of that -- does this try to be a cross-reference of sorts to that? Also, on
another point, someone might ask CD if they have problems with this wiki
posting the UFH award descriptions here so you can flesh out those articles (I
doubt they'd mind, but you still ought to ask).

    Registered FIRSTwikians and award winners? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 19:27, 30 May 2004 (EDT) 

    I don't see why it isnt feasible. Look here: [wikipedia:list of people](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_people "wikipedia:list_of_people" ). My comment above was about the need for possibly two lists, a complete one, and one with only the most important people in FIRST. If there was such an important people lists, all memebers would have their own people pages regardless of wether they have user pages, because the articles would be largely history and not just a personal "who am i" type page like the user: pages are. As for UFH awards, I'm sure its alright, if there is a complaint, we can deal with it then. BTW, Mr. 68.110.153.123, please login. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:31, 30 May 2004 (EDT) 

    the complete one not having links? And why not FIRSTwikians? Aren't we important? :) --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" )

Should it be standard for anyone assosciated with a team to have their team
number here? I think so. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 21:19, 2 Jun
