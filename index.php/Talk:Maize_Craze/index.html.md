Why did [user:138.88.66.161](/index.php?title=User:138.88.66.161&action=edit "User:138.88.66.161") change "TBA" under tournament structure to "unkown". Does he/she know that this information has been lost forever so it will always be "unkown". Maybe change it to blank, or "_to be added later_". Strange. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 19:12, 3 Jul 2004 (EDT)
