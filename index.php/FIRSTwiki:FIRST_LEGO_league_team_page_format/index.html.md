# FIRSTwiki:FIRST LEGO league team page format

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

_This is an [FIRSTwiki Official Page Format](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats
"FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ). Please use it when appropriate._

_A working example that can be found at [SMART](SMART "SMART" )._

_Your team logo should be approximately 150x150. You can modify the color of
the table heading if you like_

_You can insert this by placing {{subst:format/fllteam}}, and saving._

**Suggestions for enhancing your team page:**

    

  1. Create a page for each robot in the robots section with a link such as **[[TeamName - RobotName - Year]]**, and when you get there insert the boilerplate text for an FLL robot page by placing **{{subst:format/fllrobot}}**, and saving 
  2. Create a page for each year of your team's existence with **[[TeamName - Year]]**, and when you get there insert the boilerplate text for an FLL Team Year page by placing **{{subst:format/fllteampageyear}}**, and saving
