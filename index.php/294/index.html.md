## History

The team has a storied history. 294 traces its origins back to the original team 61, the Circuit Breakers, the first team from Southern California. In 1998, [330](330 "330") split off from 61, and in 1999, [207](207 "207") split off. The remaining rump of team 61 opted to become team 294 and have its own identity and imagery. [61](61 "61") later become the identifier of BVT Robotics, a team in Massachusetts.

The team quickly gained a reputation for success. In 2001, they won a World Championship title in the third year of their existence. Since then, they have been generally strong in Southern California competitions, winning regionals and accruing awards. Later in the decade, the team has struggled to win matches. However, strong alliances have used 294's experience and strong scoring ability to win competitions. In 2010, they were alliance captains of the alliance that won the Championship. This makes 294 one of the few teams to have won multiple Championships.

Well-known alliance partners that they have selected or have selected them include [359](359 "359"), [968](968 "968"), [469](469 "469"), and [1717](1717 "1717").
