Programs are essential to running the NXT and RCX robots used during FLL
competitions. The programs are created using a string of motor + sensor
commands on a computer and then uploaded to the robot via infrared of cable.
Although a few LEGO gurus have created their own programming languages, the
only ones permitted at the competitions are:

  * [Mindstorms RIS](/index.php?title=Mindstorms_RIS&action=edit "Mindstorms RIS" ) \- The programming language that comes with the retail LEGO Mindstorms Kit. 
  * [RoboLab](/index.php/RoboLab "RoboLab" ) \- The programming language that comes with the LEGO Education versions of Mindstorms. 
  * With the release of the new NXT, its programming software is permitted as well. 

If you order the FLL Education + Competition set as part of your team
registration, you will recieve the programming languages on a CD, whether it
is an NXT and RCX.

Teams have been equally successful using any of the languages. There are many
adherents of each. This [comparision

gives an excellent overview of the differences between the first two
languages. The above links will also have more detailed descriptions of each
language and resources.
