Programs are essential to running the NXT and RCX robots used during FLL competitions. The programs are created using a string of motor + sensor commands on a computer and then uploaded to the robot via infrared of cable. Although a few LEGO gurus have created their own programming languages, the only ones permitted at the competitions are:

- [Mindstorms RIS](/index.php?title=Mindstorms_RIS&action=edit "Mindstorms RIS") - The programming language that comes with the retail LEGO Mindstorms Kit.
- [RoboLab](RoboLab "RoboLab") - The programming language that comes with the LEGO Education versions of Mindstorms.
- With the release of the new NXT, its programming software is permitted as well.

If you order the FLL Education + Competition set as part of your team registration, you will recieve the programming languages on a CD, whether it is an NXT and RCX.

Teams have been equally successful using any of the languages. There are many adherents of each. This [comparision chart](http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/SoftwareComparisonChart.pdf "http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/SoftwareComparisonChart.pdf") (in pdf format) gives an excellent overview of the differences between the first two languages. The above links will also have more detailed descriptions of each language and resources.
