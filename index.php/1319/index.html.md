## History

**FRC 1319 was established in 2004 and was originally known as the Golden Strip Flash. Since then, we have expanded our efforts (and shortened our name) to create a positive impact on our community and the FIRST community. We have won numerous awards and been to many different regionals, including: Peachtree, Palmetto, Chesapeake, Central Florida, Boilermaker, Buckeye, and Smoky Mountains Regional. We also strive to qualify for the World Championship each year that we compete. We are an ever-growing team with many years ahead.**


## Team projects

**We have helped with many events such as volunteering at Lego League tournaments and many presentations in our community. We are actively building community partnerships and starting FLL and FTC teams.**
