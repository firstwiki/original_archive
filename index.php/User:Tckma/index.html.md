## About Me

My name's Tom. I'm a 27-year old software engineer, living in Northborough,
MA. I work for [Raytheon](http://www.raytheon.com "http://www.raytheon.com" )
Network Centric Systems in Marlborough, MA, primarily on software for domestic
and international air traffic control systems. Since 2005, I have been a
programming mentor on FIRST Team [1100](/index.php/1100 "1100" ).
Additionally, I was a programming mentor on Team [811](/index.php/811 "811" )
in 2002, 2004, and 2005, and on Team [246](/index.php/246 "246" ) in 2003.

I grew up on Long Island, and moved to New England for my job with Raytheon
after I graduated from college in 2000.

## Non-FIRST Hobbies

What do you mean, "Non-FIRST Hobbies?" Those exist?

I collect license plates. Yes, this is 100% legal. I am a member of the
[Automobile License Plate Collectors' Association](http://www.alpca.org
"http://www.alpca.org" ). I love taking random road trips, and anything to do
with roads, maps, and signs.

I also play trombone in the [Interboro Band](http://www.interboroband.org

FIRST History" )]

## My FIRST History

I became involved in FIRST in 2002 ([Zone Zeal](/index.php/Zone_Zeal "Zone
Zeal" )), shortly after breaking my leg in a skiing accident. At the time, I
lived in Nashua, NH and worked in Tewksbury, MA. A co-worker of mine who was
driving me to work had a son on Team 811 and was discussing the FIRST program
on the way to work one day. I had heard of FIRST before that time, and I had
been interested, but I did not know how to get involved. I asked if 811 needed
new mentors. The next day I hobbled into what we on 811 called "FIRST Base" on
crutches, and I have been a FIRST addict ever since. I wish they had had FIRST
when I was a high school student (1992-1996) -- later, I found out that they
did. FIRST at the time was just in its infancy and my high school did not have
a team, nor did I know of any in the area which did.

In late 2002, I received a scholarship from my company to go to graduate
school at Boston University. This required me to move to Boston Proper, and so
I left 811 temporarily in favor of the BU-sponsored team, Team 246, for 2003
([Stack Attack](/index.php/Stack_Attack "Stack Attack" )).

When I graduated that September, my job was transferred to the Marlborough
plant, but I'd had some roots in Nashua -- namely a girlfriend who lived
there. I compromised with her and moved to Chelmsford, MA. I asked to return
to Team 811 in 2004 ([First Frenzy:Raising the
Bar](/index.php?title=First_Frenzy:Raising_the_Bar&action=edit "First
Frenzy:Raising the Bar" )), since Nashua was a reasonable distance from
Chelmsford.

Over the next year, the relationship ended and I was quickly becoming fed up
with what was a 45-minute commute to work each way. I bought a house here in
Northborough, which, while an hour's drive from Nashua, shortened my commute
to 15 minutes each way, mostly along back roads. I knew to stay with 811 would
wreak havoc on my car, especially in New England winters, so I searched for a
new team closer to my new place. I joined a local community wind band, which
rehearses at the local high school. I asked the band director if he knew of
any robotics teams in the area, and he pointed me to the faculty advisor for
Team 1100. For the 2005 ([Triple Play](/index.php/Triple_Play "Triple Play" ))
season, I worked with both Team 811 and Team 1100, moving exclusively to 1100
shortly after the BAE Systems Granite State Regional that year.
