## Format and Instructions

Arbitration strives to be neutral. Therefore, users on either side of the
dispute should not submit the disagreement to the Arbitration page. Hopefully,
only neutral parties will submit the issue. Thereafter, each party can submit
their "Description of Position." If a biased "description of issue" is
presented, the disagreement will be moved to the "Biased Issues" section. When
the description is fixed, it will be moved to "Unresolved Issues." If edit
wars continue on this page, it will be protected as neccessary. Edit wars on
other pages constitute

Use the following format to add an issue:

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Arbitration&action=edit&section=2 "Edit
section: Link to page with disagreement" )]

**Users involved in dispute:**  
**Description of Issue:**  
**Description of Position 1:**  

  * supported by username1 
  * supported by username2, etc. 

**Description of Position 2:**  

  * supported by username1 
  * supported by username2, etc. 

If an administrator decides to protect the page in question, he/she will add:

**Page protected by &lt;Administrator's Name&gt; at &lt;Time of Protection&gt;**

Unprotection of that page will be indicated by:

**Page unprotected by &lt;Administrator's Name&gt; at &lt;Time of Unprotection&gt;**

Keep the list of protections/unprotections in anti-chronological order, with
most-recent on top.

Once the issue is resolved, indicate the following in addition to the above:

post votes of support._
