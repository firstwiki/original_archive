# FIRST Tech Challenge team

### From FIRSTwiki

(Redirected from [Team (FTC)](/index.php?title=Team_%28FTC%29&redirect=no
"Team \(FTC\)" ))

Jump to: navigation, search

A FIRST Tech Challenge team consists of high school
[students](/index.php/Students "Students" ), [mentors](/index.php/Mentors
"Mentors" ), and [teachers](/index.php/Teachers "Teachers" ) working together
to compete in the FIRST Tech Challenge.

They are typically smaller than [FRC
teams](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition_Team "FIRST Robotics Competition
Team" ) but larger than [FLL teams](/index.php/FIRST_LEGO_League_Team "FIRST
LEGO League Team" ). However, some FTC teams have upwards of 100 students,
while others may only have 3-5 students.

All FTC teams strive to follow the [FIRST
philosophy](/index.php/FIRST_philosophy "FIRST philosophy" ) and exhibit
[gracious professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism" ).
