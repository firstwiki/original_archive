## Team Info and History

[[edit](/index.php?title=User:MindstormsKid/Team_page_1st_half&action=edit&sec
tion=2 "User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st half" )]

### Team Name

Teddy (our team captain), suggested the team name.  
"Tera" (not "Terra"), means trillion, and Teddy read in a Wired Magazine
article that it was the current "hot number". The "storm" part came from
"Mindstorms", and the "Team" part (it's actually part of the name) was used
because Teddy didn't think "Terastorm" sounded good.

### How the team was started

Teddy read a newspaper article about FLL, and decided that he would create a
team when he saw that the Chattanooga Engineers Club would sponsor any team in
the Chattanooga area.

### Tennessee State Tournament

Wow! This was a huge tournament, with 57 teams from all over the state and
over 450 kids in it! We got no awards, but we did get the 13th overall score,
and we got a call back for the Robot Design interview (there were seven teams
that got a call back and six of them got an award).
