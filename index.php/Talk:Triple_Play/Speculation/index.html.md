Why is this page titled "FIRST Frenzy: Undefined"? Why not "Unknown 2005 Game" or something that disregards the "FIRST Frenzy" which is not confirmed? --[SilverStar (Advay)](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar") 03:48, 30 Dec 2004 (EST)

I think you are right. --[[User:Max|[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](1257 "1257" )]]] 14:47, 30 Dec 2004 (EST)

Billfred, the last edit concering a [Dave Lavery](Dave_Lavery "Dave
Lavery") sighting is kinda funny, but it isn't really relevant. Post stuff like that in the talk page or something and lets try to keep the quality of content up. --[[User:Max|[Max](User:Max "User:Max") [[1257](1257 "1257")]]] 14:18, 22 Sep 2004 (EDT)

Gotcha. --[Billfred](User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 19:24, 22 Sep 2004 (EDT)
