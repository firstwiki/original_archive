Why is this page titled "FIRST Frenzy: Undefined"? Why not "Unknown 2005 Game"
or something that disregards the "FIRST Frenzy" which is not confirmed?

    I think you are right. --[[User:Max|[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](1257 "1257" )]]] 14:47, 30 Dec 2004 (EST) 

Billfred, the last edit concering a [Dave Lavery](Dave_Lavery "Dave
Lavery" ) sighting is kinda funny, but it isn't really relevant. Post stuff
like that in the talk page or something and lets try to keep the quality of
content up. --[[User:Max|[Max](User:Max "User:Max" )

    Gotcha. --[Billfred](User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 19:24, 22 Sep 2004 (EDT)
