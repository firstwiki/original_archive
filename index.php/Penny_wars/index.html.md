# Penny wars

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A penny war is a type of [fundraiser](Fundraising "Fundraising" )
that is used by [FIRST](first) teams. A traditional penny
war is held between multiple parts of the student body, either by homeroom,
grade, club, or other method. Students then bring in pennies, which are put in
their group's jar. Members of other groups may then attack the jar by putting
in money of other denominations (nickels, dimes, quarters, half-dollars,
dollar coins, or any folding money). The amount of non-penny currency is then
subtracted from the amount of pennies, giving that group's score. The group
with the highest score wins, and usually wins some prize such as a pizza
party.
