## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

In the [2007 Game](2007_Game "2007 Game"), teams were allowed to choose from three different Weight Classes. The greater your weight, the shorter your [Starting Size](Starting_Size "Starting Size"). The weight classes are:

- 120 pounds or less -> 4 feet or shorter
- 110 pounds or less -> 5 feet or shorter
- 100 pounds or less -> 6 feet or shorter

These [Weight Restrictions](/index.php?title=Weight_Restrictions&action=edit "Weight Restrictions") and [Size Restrictions](/index.php?title=Size_Restrictions&action=edit "Size
Restrictions") do not account for the [Bumpers](/index.php?title=Bumper&action=edit "Bumper") or the [Battery](Battery "Battery").
