### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

In the [2007 Game](2007_Game "2007 Game" ), teams were allowed to
choose from three different Weight Classes. The greater your weight, the
shorter your [Starting Size](Starting_Size "Starting Size" ). The
weight classes are:

  * 120 pounds or less -> 4 feet or shorter 
  * 110 pounds or less -> 5 feet or shorter 
  * 100 pounds or less -> 6 feet or shorter 

These [Weight Restrictions](/index.php?title=Weight_Restrictions&action=edit
"Weight Restrictions" ) and [Size
Restrictions](/index.php?title=Size_Restrictions&action=edit "Size
Restrictions" ) do not account for the
[Bumpers](/index.php?title=Bumper&action=edit "Bumper" ) or the
[Battery](Battery "Battery" ).
