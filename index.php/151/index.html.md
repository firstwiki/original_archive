## History

Team 151 (Formally known as the _**Wild Cards**_ and now known as the _**Tough
Techs**_) started with a company named Ferrofluidics for the 1991-1992
robotics season. The relationship lasted until one year later when
Ferrofluidics ended their brief sponsorship with Nashua High School. Nashua
High School's Science Department did not want to lose such a valuable teaching
tool, so they approached Sanders; their "Partners in Education," to present to
them the positive aspects of supporting the FIRST Robotics Program. They
planted the seed and their goals for a corporate sponsor became a reality.
Since 1993, Team 151 and Sanders bonded by the FIRST mantra of technology and
gracious professionalism. The school and the corporation were in a win-win
situation: the students were mentored by Sanders Engineers while the company
was developing future employees for the corporation's family. The relationship
continued to grow throughout the corporation's many buy-outs and changes. Each
subsequent owner recognized the value of the FIRST program as the vehicle for
future engineers for the company (now called [BAE
SYSTEMS](http://www.baesystems.com/ "http://www.baesystems.com/" )) and
therefore kept the program going. The students continued to gleam knowledge
from the engineers and, as a result, the team won the 1995 Chairman's Award,
as well as many technical and animation awards.

In 2001, Team #[166](/index.php/166 "166" ) lost their sponsor and approached
BAE, resulting in altering the way Nashua High School was used to performing
their tasks. The team now had to share their sponsor, the working area,
machine shop, equipment and tools. No longer did they have 100% of each
engineers time, everything had to be shared. This was a drastic change for the
students but, believing in the Gracious Professionalism of FIRST, embraced
Team #166 as the new siblings to the BAE FIRST family. Team 151 and Team 166
shouted enthusiastically at the competitions: "TWO Bots, ONE Team."

From 2002 to the present, BAE slowly gave the reins of responsibility back to
the school while still being their corporate sponsor. This allowed BAE to
spread its corporate wings to save more FIRST teams from folding over due to
lack of sponsors. There have been a lot of growing pains but the team was
determined to positively take ownership. Team 151 felt more empowered and in
control of their team. As a result of the many changes through the years, Team
151 has matured, grown stronger and they now realize that working hard and
being responsible for what they are doing can be very satisfying.

Since 2004, Team 151 has made an effort to build the robot using the high
schools' facilities. In 2005 about 50% of the manufactured parts were produced
at BAE, and in 2006 more than 99% of the robot was fabricated by students in
the high school machine shop.

Team 151's primary sponsor is BAE Systems, who provides mentors and resources
to aid our team. In the past, [Got-Ink-4U](http://www.gotink4u.com/
"http://www.gotink4u.com/" ) and [BAWLS](http://www.bawls.com/
"http://www.bawls.com/" ) have been key supporters for their successful,
fundraising LAN parties with donations of supplies and materials. Panera Bread
restaurants in Nashua have donated delicious, baked goods to expand our
fundraising opportunities during LAN parties and LEGO League competitions.

In 2006, Team 151 received the "Best Website" award for the now-defunct
toughtechs.org. The team's new website is now at
[toughtechs151.org](http://www.toughtechs151.org
"http://www.toughtechs151.org" ). In addition to a brand new design, the team
website also includes an alternative "classic view" to satisfy those fond of
the original look of the site.
