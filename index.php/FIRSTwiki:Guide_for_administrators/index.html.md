_In general, if you aren't absolutlely sure, don't do it. Things can wait._

The following policies strive to keep the wiki a civil place. It is a
collaborative project, and the contributors and founders have a common goal:
to provide a much needed encylopedic resource for the FIRST community. The
**guidelines** below are still evolving, but they try to provide an atmosphere
where everyone can work towards the common goal. In this regard, remember that
a calm and level head is much better than undue rashness -- ask another sysop
who is on duty what the best course of action is and consider waiting a day
before serious action is taken.

## You do not have more power than other FIRSTwikians

Just as with any other user, any major or controversial changes should be
discussed on talk pages. In such discussions, your adminship should not be
considered in any arguments. Regular users may defer to you because of your
experience, but that is purely their choice.

n=2 "Edit section: Responsibilities" )]

## Responsibilities


### Deleting pages

As of now, our small size does not neccistate the very elaborate method of
page deleting seen on Wikipedia (2 or 3 different pages:suggesting, voting,
deletion). Most deletions will be relatively obvious, but as always, _if you
aren't absolutely sure, don't do it_.


### Blocking users and dealing with vandalism

In all possible cases, blocking users should be **avoided**. Attempt should be
made to contact the user and warn him. It is very possible a new user may be
accidentally doing bad things. Absolutley warn the user in his "user talk:"
page, multiple times. Even then, be cautious about blocking users because it
is also possible that the new user might not notice the "new messages" at the
top of the page. This is a serious action which, if carried out poorly, can
adversely affect the wiki and the common goal we strive for. Please read
[FIRSTwiki:Dealing with vandalism](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Dealing_with_vandalism
"FIRSTwiki:Dealing with vandalism" ) before taking any action.

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Guide_for_administrators&action=edit&sectio
n=5 "Edit section: Correcting style" )]

### Correcting style

In striving for open content, we place very little restriction on how people
choose to edit. We don't require that people even read the [style
guide](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Style_guide "FIRSTwiki:Style guide" ), -- or even
beg that they adhere to it. This is the job of everyone, and especially of
administrators. Make sure that articles adhere to the correct naming
conventions, particularly. If a page is not in compliance, merely fix the
problem. If a certain user happens to be comitting the same mistake again and
again, leave a message in his talk page, kindly directing him to the
appropriate help pages. When moving pages, make sure to follow the guidelines
at [How to move a page](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:How_to_move_a_page "FIRSTwiki:How
to move a page" ).


##  Site notice

You can change the site status (the line at the top that appears occasionally)
by modifying [MediaWiki:sitenotice](/index.php/MediaWiki:Sitenotice
"MediaWiki:Sitenotice" ). Note that the page is locked, so only sysops can
change it.
