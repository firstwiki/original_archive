## History

  * The Bomb Squad, begun in 1996, is one of the oldest and most decorated 

Arkansas State Lego League Tournament; sponsored by Baxter Healthcare Inc.;
hosted by STG and the Bomb Squad

sustained teams in FIRST. A handful of engineers, an English teacher, and a
history teacher with big dreams for the students in our small town developed a
part- nership between the Baxter Healthcare facility in Mountain Home,
Arkansas andMountain Home High School that would result in one of the most
impressive legacies in the FIRST community.A brilliant start would net the
team four consecutive Chairman?s Award Fi- nalist finishes at the national
level and culminate in a Chairman?s Award in 2000.Only the eighth team to win
this ultimate prize that has been awarded to a mere eighteen teams, the Bomb
Squad struggled with a “what to do now ?” dilemma.

  * The partnership with Baxter Healthcare ended after the 2004 season and it 

looked like the team would retire on its significant accomplishments, but a
few of the mentors, the English teacher, and the history teacher, the students
(and a lot of community fans) couldn?t let go. So the team that was rich in
resources, success, and reputation ended up inthe attic of the gym with
borrowed tools and a serious case of “what do we do now?” What we did was
continue to get students excited about technology and determined to be
excellent no matter what our financial or facility situation. Our community
stepped up and supported the team even though we had no corporate sponsor - an
“impossible” position for an FRC team. But we are the Bomb Squad; we
specialize in impossible situations.

  * Several mentors and supporters founded the Science and Technology Group (STG), a non-profit corporation, to promote technology education in Mountain Home. STG took over the management and funding of the Bomb Squad and Arkansas FIRST LEGO League. Baxter Healthcare committed financial support to the team for the 2008, 2009, 2010 and current season. While we certainly hope to continue as a Baxter team, we now know we can survive and succeed on our own. We still do not have a facility, but have been fortunate to find suitable spaces to borrow or rent for each build season. 
  * The Bomb Squad is a cherished icon in our town. We are a popular participant in multiple community events including parades, summer celebrations, the county fair, and school demonstrations. We have expanded the program to include our Junior High students by forming an FTC team, the Junior Bomb Squad, in 2006. This team is well on its way to a reputation as excellent as the FRC team by winning a Regional event in each of its second, third, and fourth seasons. This young team even won the 2009 FTC World Championship. 
  * Nearly 300 students have been inspired to excel by this team and most all of these have attended college. At least six of our former team members have gone on to start or mentor FIRST teams; one of our alumni was Dean Kamen?s Chief of Staff. The totality of personal and professional success of our students is truly remarkable and is the validation for all the commitment and sacrifice of our mentors and volunteers. 
  * An Arkansas Governor?s Summit on Education and Economic Development included our FIRST program in 12 “Great Partnerships Around Our State, Some Great Examples of Public/Private/Business Partnerships That Are Getting Things Done.” Governor Beebe visited Mountain Home High School and met with the Bomb Squad -he even drove our robot. 
  * Team 16 was selected as one of 17 FRC teams to beta test the new 2009 control system and train a portion of the other 1700 teams. We traveled to Kansas City and St. Louis to demonstrate the new control system and offered training workshops to over 70 teams from 3 states. 
  * In fifteen seasons of competition the Bomb Squad has earned and maintained a position in the FIRST Hall of Fame. In addition to the Chairman’s Award, Team 16 won a Creativity Award at the Championship level. In 2008 the team was a Division Champion and earned a World Finalist medal. The many Regional honors bestowed upon the Bomb Squad include 8 Regional Championships, 38 Regional Awards and 2005 Woodie Flowers Finalist and 2009 Championship Woodie Flower award winner John Novak.
