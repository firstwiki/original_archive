**Team 1396's "One-Day Wonder"** was a robot constructed during the 2004 [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) [Championship Event](/index.php/Championship_Event "Championship Event" ). Team [1396](/index.php/1396 "1396" )'s original robot had been shipped to Atlanta, Georgia, for the Championship, but due to a shipping error, it was then shipped back to their home school. Therefore, when the team arrived in the Georgia World Congress Center, it had no robot. 

Other teams, in an astounding show of [Gracious
Professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism" ), pitched in tools, materials, electronics, parts, and
manpower to allow 1396 to build a brand new robot in ten hours on Thursday. It
did take the field in one practice match on Thursday, although a problem with
a [drill motor](/index.php/Drill_motor "Drill motor" ) sidelined it early in
the match.

By Friday, the team had received electronics from their original robot via
overnight delivery. Over Friday and Saturday, the team went 4-3-0, seeding
number 33 out of 73 teams. On Saturday, the team also received the [Judges'
Award](/index.php/Judges%27_Award "Judges' Award" ).
