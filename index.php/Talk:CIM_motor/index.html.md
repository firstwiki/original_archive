After looking at www.usfirst.org's spec sheets, I think the more proper name
might be CIM, not chiaphua. See
[[1]](http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Specs/Chiaphua.jpg
"http://www2.usfirst.org/2004comp/Specs/Chiaphua.jpg" ) and

##  Infobox motor Template

I updated with the Infobox motor template I created. As for changing the title
of this page, I feel it should be changed and updated with latest info, which
I may do later. \--[Nibbles](/index.php?title=User:Nibbles&action=edit
