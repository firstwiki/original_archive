### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

[Max](/index.php?title=Max&action=edit "Max" ), I noticed you added an inter-
wiki link. Is this a documented feature? I've linked to wikipedia before, and
knowing about this will be helpful. If it isn't on the help pages, it should
go there. (Unfortunately I've got to go know, so I'll do the classic mention
it and leave it for someone else to do ;) --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls

My proposed nesting thing is backslashes.

proposed nesting thing? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" )

    Threads, related articles, etc. Wiki apparently does not supply a nested topic setup. --[user:Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" )

    

    There is no "topic" system at all, but look at wikipedia and you will see plenty of nicely organized articles. A 

"topic system" isn't actually a good idea as you have it propsed because very
littl stuff is only organized in a top down way where only pages higher in a
hierarchy link to lower ones. MediaWiki 1.3 will support categories that will
help automatically index types of pages and show relationship somewhat, but a
strictly top down hierarchy by no means, it is. (Yoda?).

Regardless, something about FIRSTwiki itself doesn't belong in the (main)
namespace (articles with no xxxx: prefix), it would belong in the FIRSTwiki:
namespace like maybe [FIRSTwiki:to
do](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:To_do&action=edit "FIRSTwiki:To do" )
