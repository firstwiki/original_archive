The [Junior FIRST LEGO
League](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/default.aspx?pid=18130
"http://www.firstlegoleague.org/default.aspx?pid=18130" ) is a spin-off of the
[FLL](FLL "FLL" ) program. The JFLL is for elementary school age
children.

Created in partnership with the LEGO Group, Junior FIRST LEGO League (JFLL) is
geared to children aged 6 to 9 years old and utilizes a modified FIRST LEGO
League (FLL) framework.

Teams of up to 6 children and an adult mentor receive a "mini challenge",
based on the annual FLL research project. Using an open-ended LEGO building
set, they will design a model depicting an aspect of this year’s FLL
Challenge. Children will spend approximately one month exploring,
investigating, designing and building a model made with LEGO bricks. In
conjunction, teams create a "Show Me" poster that depicts the teams’
experience during this process, through drawings and words.

Teams are encouraged to gather together and hold local events to share their
experiences with family and friends. Anyone is able to hold an event - tips,
suggestions, and "how to" are offered in the [JFLL Event
Guide](/index.php?title=JFLL_Event_Guide&action=edit "JFLL Event Guide" ).
