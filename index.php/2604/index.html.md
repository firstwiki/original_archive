##  History

Metal &amp; Soul was founded in late 2007 by a mentor from 1718 and a Capac
School Board member, John Antilla. John made a presentation in front of some
people and got a few members interested. They would eventually join and the
team grew to it's current size after the first presentation in December 2007.
John got us our first sponsors and some of our other mentors in addition to
talking to the Fighting Pi about helping us out. We got our machine shop
(where we build) about 1 week into the 2008 build season.
