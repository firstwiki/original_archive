**Mentors** are adult participants on a [FIRST Robotics team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team" ). [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) lists the various roles of a mentor as being able to: 

  * Inspire students in science and technology 
  * Motivate and engage students in meaningful activities 
  * Create open communication 
  * Facilitate instruction and have students do as much work as possible 

The mentor works with the [students](/index.php/Student "Student" ), trying to
develop a relationship where the student can learn and grow as a person. There
are many different types of mentors on a team. A mentor can be an engineer or
a physicist, a [teacher](/index.php/Teacher "Teacher" ), a college student,
[alumni](/index.php/Alumni "Alumni" ), or any other [team
advisor](/index.php/Team_advisor "Team advisor" ) that helps in some way.
FIRST is _not_ about [robots](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ), it is about
inspiring students in science and technology and, whatever their intended
careers, instilling in them the idea of [gracious
professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism" ). FIRST is about the student, -- and an engineer or a writer
mentoring the team is equally useful to the project.
