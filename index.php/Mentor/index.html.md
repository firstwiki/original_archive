**Mentors** are adult participants on a [FIRST Robotics team](FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team"). [FIRST](first) lists the various roles of a mentor as being able to:

- Inspire students in science and technology
- Motivate and engage students in meaningful activities
- Create open communication
- Facilitate instruction and have students do as much work as possible

The mentor works with the [students](Student "Student"), trying to develop a relationship where the student can learn and grow as a person. There are many different types of mentors on a team. A mentor can be an engineer or a physicist, a [teacher](Teacher "Teacher"), a college student, [alumni](Alumni "Alumni"), or any other [team advisor](Team_advisor "Team advisor") that helps in some way. FIRST is _not_ about [robots](Robot "Robot"), it is about inspiring students in science and technology and, whatever their intended careers, instilling in them the idea of [gracious professionalism](Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism"). FIRST is about the student, -- and an engineer or a writer mentoring the team is equally useful to the project.
