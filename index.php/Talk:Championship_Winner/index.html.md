    The Archive.org archive of the 1993 results do not have results for that year, nor can the current results database be trusted for results prior to 1995. The [811](/index.php/811 "811" ) page says they came in 9th in 1993, and this is the only place I have found that shows 811 as winning (it was in the original version). [148's page](/index.php/148 "148" ) says they won. Also, [148's website](http://www.robowranglers.com/history/ "http://www.robowranglers.com/history/" ) claims they won that year. During the 2008 finals on Einstein, Dave Verbrugge announced that 148 had won a previous championship. Furthermore, there is a chiefdelphi post about [148 having the banner](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=751969&postcount=7 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=751969&postcount=7" ). Finally there are two [lists](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=57149 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=57149" ) of [champions](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=47714 "http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=47714" ) on chiefdelphi that show 148 as champion in 1993 --[Sciencewhiz](/index.php/User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz" ) 13:43, 9 June 2008 (EDT)
