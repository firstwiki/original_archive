I did a slight overhaul of the page. But much more needs to be done. As
evidenced on CD already, a lot of people haven't heard of a wiki before, and
the whole concept of open content is foreign -- let alone using such arcane
magic as ''' and * || [[asdf]]. I based this page on
[Wikipedia:Help](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help "wikipedia:Help" ), but
left some things out that should definately go in. Also, I think the
arbitration stuff should be moved to [Policies and guidelines for
contributors](/index.php/Policies_and_guidelines_for_contributors "Policies
and guidelines for contributors" ), but figured I'd wait until we had
organized ourselves some more policies and guidelines.

That has got to be the silliest thing I've seen!

    I'll assume you are referring to my latest edit. It sounds funny at first, but it makes sense. It is important for content to get added, even if it is formatted improperly or has bad spelling or is in the wrong place. If you still don't agree, well, it wasn't my idea, there is a page on wikipedia that says the same thing (though I can't really find it right now.) --[max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" )

    

    We have something similar on [FIRSTwiki:Style guide](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Style_guide "FIRSTwiki:Style guide" ). Maybe we don't want to say "scare", -- most people probably don't want to be told that they are scared. Perhaps something like, You can start contributing right away. The below is meant only to aid you, and in the event that it is confusing or you don't otherwise want to follow the guidelines, please don't feel obligated to. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 17:21, 22 Jun 2004 (EDT)
