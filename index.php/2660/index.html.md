## History

Monikka Mann &amp; Don Prier (Engineers at B/E Aerospace in Marysville) were
involved with Team [2222](/index.php/2222 "2222" ) \- Abebotics in 2007. When
they moved up from the South Puget Sound, they wanted to continue working with
FRC and due to its location, Arts &amp; Technology High School was a logical
choice. Principal Redmond, Ms. Jordan &amp; Mr. Fitzpatrick all jumped on the
FIRST Train and are working with a core group of students to make 2008 FRC at
Arts &amp; Technology a reality!

The team was finally founded on December 13 with 2 days left for the
registration deadline. It all somehow worked out and almost all team members
showed up in Bellevue,WA for the FIRST Kickoff on January 5th. For most of the
Students this was the first big thing in regards to FRC. Since we are a 2008
Rookie team except Monikka and Don no one else knew what we should really
expect from this competition. The first week back in school our group, now
knowing the idea of the game, brainstormed and brainstormed and it stormed so
hard we could not even see the path we were going. In the end the storm formed
into a "gokart with a forklift". Thats what we try to build.
