A **FIRST LEGO League Team** consists of up to ten (10) students aged 9 to 14
years (9 to 16 outside of the United States). These may be elementary, middle
, or high school students (see [FLL Get
Involved](http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flg_gi.htm
"http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flg_gi.htm" )).

An FLL team will typically have 1 or 2 coaches, and may also have mentors to
mentor the team in programming, basic building/engineering, teamwork, or that
year's research project theme.

There are some obvious differences between [FIRST
teams](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics Team" ) and FLL teams.
For example, on [FIRST team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics
Team" )'s mentors are often active participants in building the robot. In FLL,
this is strongly discouraged. "Direct adult involvement or intervention during
the problem solving process is strongly discouraged." (see [Starting a
Team](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/default.aspx?pid=3590
"http://www.firstlegoleague.org/default.aspx?pid=3590" ))

Coaches of FLL teams are often teachers or parents. Mentors can be teachers,
parents, professionals, etc. One strong trend is encouraging [FIRST Robotics
Team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics Team" ) members to be
mentors to FLL teams or in some cases even coach teams.

In First Lego League **FLL Values** and **Gracious Professionalism** are the
order of the day (see [FLL Values Defined](http://www.firstlegoleague.org/site
mod/upload/Root/America/FLL_Values.pdf
"http://www.firstlegoleague.org/sitemod/upload/Root/America/FLL_Values.pdf"
)).
