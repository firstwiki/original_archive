# Assembly

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Assembly** is close to machine language, i.e., the basic instructions that a computer processes. It is a low-level language, without the sophistication of C, for instance, but is used because it can produce faster software than a high level language. But any errors in your code may be fatal. The standard extension for a file containing assembly is .asm.

## Inlining assembly in C

It is possible to use assembly code with a C program by beginning and ending a block of assembly with `_asm` and `_endasm` respectively
