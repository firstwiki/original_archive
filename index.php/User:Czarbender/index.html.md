## Chris Pineda

I'm 17 years young, I play video games constantly, I own a Nintendo DS and a
Wii because I detest Sony as a company, and I have a strict Nintendo First,
Sony Second policy when it comes to video games. I have a Dell Inspiron 6000
laptop, which I am using at this moment. I live in Encino, California, which
is a small wealthy city in Los Angeles. This is relatively the same as my
Wikipedia article, so it's missing my user boxes and i might have somethings
here that belong to Wikipedia. I'm also on team [3536](/index.php/3536 "3536"
), The Reseda Regent Robotics. This is also the same username I have in
Wikipedia if you want to take a look at it.

What I Stand For" )]

## What I Stand For

I stand for video game rights, both from consoles and computer games. I also
stand for the integration of the Metal Gear Solid series onto Nintendo.

What I Stand Against" )]

## What I Stand Against

I stand against injustices, particularly between rival gaming consoles,
PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

What I Don't Like" )]

## What I Don't Like

Ghetto People, Rap, R&amp;B, Country, Pop, or any other stupid subcultures of
those Genres. I also don't like Wiki HTML (The special HTML used for Wiki
Markup). It annoys the hell out of me.
