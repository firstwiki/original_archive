Um, I filled in some stuff on my user page and it looks like it was put in the
Official Page Formats. I guess I did that somehow, I don't know. How do I fix
it? -[Kel D](/index.php/User:Kel_D "User:Kel D" )

    Looks fine to me - according to your User contribution page, you haven't edited the Official Page Formats. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:16, 8 Aug 2004 (EDT)

Is that server actually yours? because the server "excalibur.esper.net" has
about a billion seperate channels, and the closest to FIRST I've found yet is
BattleBots! Or am I not getting this?

    It's not my server by any means, just as the Wikipedia chat (which is on irc.freenode.net) isn't on a Wikipedia server. The servers are controlled by the network that you're on (there are several networks, EsperNet just happens to be my favorite one). However, EsperNet, like many other IRC networks, allows channel registration. Therefore, I "own" the #friarbot channel, as well as a couple others. [IRC](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC "wikipedia:IRC" ) [![Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)](/index.php/Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF "Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ) is probably a good place for a clearer explanation. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:31, 17 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    I don't actually speak German, but I hang around enough people who do on IRC that I can recognize it a bit when I see it. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:32, 14 Jun 2004 (EDT)

What does your name mean??? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 14:30, 1

    Yeah really, what the heck? --[Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) 16:44, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
    Ditto --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 16:55, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Meh, I don't really know myself - it's just a random word I made up back in fifth grade that I use as my general-purpose online name. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:04, 1 Jun 2003 (EDT) 

So is it goo-ber-**gunch**? --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303
"User:Astronouth7303" )

    that's how i read it --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:12, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Either "**Goo**-ber-gunch" or "Goo-ber-**gunch**" work.

**I know** how to make thumbnails man! It's just wasteful to upload them when wikipedia has an automatic feature. I just wanted to know **how**! :-) By the way, thanks for your recent contribs and remember to spread the word --[Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) 15:42, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    I've already posted this in about 5 or 6 different locations because, once again, i'm not sure how to get people's attention, but [wikipedia:wikipedia:extended image sytnax](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:extended_image_sytnax "wikipedia:wikipedia:extended_image_sytnax" ) \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:44, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Can you double check that link? There isn't an article. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 15:51, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Try [wikipedia:wikipedia:Extended image syntax](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:Extended_image_syntax "wikipedia:wikipedia:Extended_image_syntax" ) (yeah, I know, it's probably been done already....) --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:39, 12 Jun 2004 (EDT)
