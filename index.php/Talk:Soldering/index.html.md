# Talk:Soldering

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The use of a header to signify an introduction is not necessary, as the first
thing the reader sees should by standard be the introduction. The reason for
excluding it is so that it appears before the TOC, and also that the BIG
header can distract the user, rather than orient him to the opening text.
Also, a lot of this information should be moved to a how-to guide on
soldering, and this article should be confined to explain what soldering is,
its usefulness and then refer to other resources. The how-to guide is,
undoubtedly, good and useful ... but it belongs elsewhere IMO.
