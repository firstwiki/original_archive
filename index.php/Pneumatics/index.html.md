    _[FIRST Lego League](/index.php/FIRST_Lego_League "FIRST Lego League" ) also has a page about [Pneumatics](/index.php/Pneumatics_%28FLL%29 "Pneumatics \(FLL\)" )._

[![Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)](/index.php/I
mage:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF "Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ) is a system in which
pressurized gases (air in the case of FIRST), are used to move actuators such
as [cylinders](/index.php/Cylinder "Cylinder" ) or [rotary
actuators](/index.php/Rotary_actuator "Rotary actuator" ).

Advantages" )]

## Advantages

  * Force and speed are both infinitely adjustable later without any part changes (via regulator and flow valve adjustments) 
  * Natural linear motion, making interfacing with structure simple (no rotational motion conversion required) 
  * Very high direct forces possible (up to 188 lbs) without any mechanical reduction (higher forces possible with external mechanical advantage) 
  * New action/release possible after end of round 
  * Continued force possible after end of round 
  * Stallable forever without draining battery, action continues whenever resistance ends 
  * Servo positioning control possible (with feedback sensor and proper valving) 
  * Plug-in tubing makes routing, changes, and providing small amounts of work in odd places simple 
  * Very useful for: device deployment/actuation, doors, gates, releases, parking lockup, alternate drive/wheel swapping, vacuum generation, and gearbox switching 


## Disadvantages

  * Large initial weight cost 
    * [Compressor](/index.php/Compressor "Compressor" )
    * [Storage tank](/index.php/Storage_tank "Storage tank" )(s) 
  * Routing hoses can be difficult 
  * Total power/energy output is less than that achievable with motors 
  * Frequent use will drop air pressure faster than the compressor can raise it, resulting in a severe performance drop.
