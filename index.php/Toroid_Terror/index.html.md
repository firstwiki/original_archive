Toroid Terror Scoring Structure

The field was a carpeted hexagon. In the center was an 8 foot tall pyramid structure (made of Kee-Klamps and schedule 40 pipe) with 3 posts coming out of each vertical edge. The pyramid was fixed in the center of the field, but could rotate about its center point.

In each corner of the hexagon field, there was a stack of inner tubes, 1 each of red, white and blue, which were the colors of the team. Each human player also started with 3 innertubes, of the teams color.

## Game Description

The goal was to score the inner tubes on the pyramid structure. You got one point for every inner tube on the scoring structure, and your score was doubled if it was directly over the center column (like the white tubes in the picture). You also doubled your score if you had 3 in a vertical column on the scoring posts.

## Tournament Structure

The main tournament was double elimination, in which every team competed. The matches were 1v1v1 where the top scoring team was the winner and the other two lost. When it got down to the final 16 teams, the game switched to 1v1.

## Kit Of Parts

- Robots were powered by 2 12v drill batteries

## Rules

The robot size requirement was raised to 3'x3'x4' for Toroid Terror. This had the disadvantage that robots couldn't fit through a standard doorway, and there were rumors of robots being assembled in a room, and when they tried to take it out to ship, it wouldn't fit through a door. The size requirement was changed for the following years to 3'x30"x4'.

## Strategies

The most popular strategy was to extend the height of the center column (which would only hold one inner tube). Teams would put a tube or similar structure on top of the center column, which would allow more inner tubes to fit centered above the column.

## Robots

Team [121's](121 "121") robot, Aquatread intentionally tipped its opponents.

Team [47](47 "47") would block the opponent's player's station in the finals, which were only 1v1\. This stopped many teams from scoring and helped them to second place.

Beatty & Hammond [71](71 "71") won the championship because they pulled off the center capping strategy faster and smoother then anyone else.

## Misc Info

- The [Placebo](Placebo "Placebo") was called showbot and shot confetti into the crowd.
