Toroid Terror Scoring Structure

The field was a carpeted hexagon. In the center was an 8 foot tall pyramid
structure (made of Kee-Klamps and schedule 40 pipe) with 3 posts coming out of
each vertical edge. The pyramid was fixed in the center of the field, but
could rotate about its center point.

In each corner of the hexagon field, there was a stack of inner tubes, 1 each
of red, white and blue, which were the colors of the team. Each human player
also started with 3 innertubes, of the teams color.


## Game Description

The goal was to score the inner tubes on the pyramid structure. You got one
point for every inner tube on the scoring structure, and your score was
doubled if it was directly over the center column (like the white tubes in the
picture). You also doubled your score if you had 3 in a vertical column on the
scoring posts.


## Tournament Structure

The main tournament was double elimination, in which every team competed. The
matches were 1v1v1 where the top scoring team was the winner and the other two
lost. When it got down to the final 16 teams, the game switched to 1v1.


## Kit Of Parts

  * Robots were powered by 2 12v drill batteries 


## Rules

The robot size requirement was raised to 3'x3'x4' for Toroid Terror. This had
the disadvantage that robots couldn't fit through a standard doorway, and
there were rumors of robots being assembled in a room, and when they tried to
take it out to ship, it wouldn't fit through a door. The size requirement was
changed for the following years to 3'x30"x4'.


## Strategies

The most popular strategy was to extend the height of the center column (which
would only hold one inner tube). Teams would put a tube or similar structure
on top of the center column, which would allow more inner tubes to fit
centered above the column.


## Robots

Team [121's](121 "121" ) robot, Aquatread intentionally tipped its
opponents.

Team [47](47 "47" ) would block the opponent's player's station in
the finals, which were only 1v1. This stopped many teams from scoring and
helped them to second place.

Beatty &amp; Hammond [71](71 "71" ) won the championship because
they pulled off the center capping strategy faster and smoother then anyone
else.


## Misc Info

  * The [Placebo](Placebo "Placebo" ) was called showbot and shot confetti into the crowd.
