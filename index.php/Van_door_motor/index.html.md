# Van door motor

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Note that the Van Door motor for 2005 is different from previous years. The
Shaft is longer and the threads are positioned differently. The casing has
flat sides and the motor head is shaped a little differently (although the
mounting hole pattern is the same).

It should also be noted that this year's van door motors appear to be the same
as the motors from a few years back, but this years turn a diferent number of
RPM's so it's not a good idea to run this year's and a previous year's van
door motors together. They may not get alone well. ;)
