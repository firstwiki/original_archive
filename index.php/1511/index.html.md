##  History

2004-2005

Rolling Thunder is FIRST Robotics team 1511, of Penfield High School in
Penfield, New York. It was founded in the fall of 2004 through a partnership
with Harris Corp., a local company. The team includes about 30 volunteers and
40 students. Volunteers range from electrical engineers to programmers and
marketing experts.

The "Rolling Thunder" team, a partnership between Penfield High School and
Harris Corporation's RF Communications Division participated for the first
time in the 2004-2005 FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) called "Triple Play".
The team entered and participated in the Finger Lakes, Buckeye and Toronto
Regionals, as well as the Championships. The team won the FLR Rookie All Star,
Cleveland Rookie Highest Seed, and Toronto Rookie Inspiration and Team Spirit.

In the end, the team won the Championship "Rookie All Star" award; the highest
honor bestowable to a 1st year team.

2005-2006

In our 2nd season, the RollingThunder Team grew to over 50 students and 20
mentors. led by Kim O'Toole from Harris Corp., RF Communications division, the
"Rolling Thunder" team designed and competed a robot in the 2006 FRC regional
in the Finger Lakes, then on to the Boston Regional, and then to the world
championship. The team won the Finger Lakes Engineering Inspiration and Boston
Imagery Awards.

2006-2007

In our 3rd season, the team is led by Kim O'Toole for the 2007 FRC
"Rack-N-Roll" game. The team also established mentorship/sponsorship for over
14 FLL Lego League teams in our region. Rolling Thunder, again, attended the
Finger Lakes Regional, the Boston Regional, and The World Championships. They
were ranked as the fourth seed in Boston and the seventh seed at the World
Championships. Events this year included "The Finger Lakes Regional Chairman's
Award" and The Boston Regional Webpage and Spirit Awards.

2008-2009

In our fifth season, the team was led by Kim Eckhardt, who stepped down as
leader after this season, for the 2009 FRC "Lunacy" game. The team worked
avidly with team 2999 during the build season to help them build their robot.
The team attended two regionals, FLR and Annapolis, as well as the World
Chamionships hosted in Atlanta Georgia. The team was part of the 2nd place
alliance at FLR, and won the Regional Chairman's Award at the Annapolis
regional. They also took home an award from the World Chamionships for their
first time since their rookie year in 2005, the judge's award. They won the
award for "Integrated Performance".


##  Team projects

  * The Rah Cha Cha Ruckus is a Halloween-themed post season event that is organized by a special commitee of members of local FIRST teams as well as Rolling Thunder. There is time for the year's competition, and then time set aside for fun events (Like Drag Races and Mentor Matches). There have been halloween costume parties in the past.

"http://www.ruckus.penfieldrobotics.com" )

  * Project Girl Wrench is a program designed to get females more interested in science and technology. This year the program worked with 10 students and 4 mentors, and the girls spent time over the summer revamping our 2005 drivetrain, and building a Vex bot to compete in the Ruckus Wiffle Wallop Competition. 
  * FLL has become a major project for our team, in 2006 sponsoring &amp; mentoring 15 FLL teams, and we ran 3 summer camps for middle school students, as well as a coaches camp to help orient the coaches &amp; mentors on how to work with the middle school students. We also run the Rochester Razzle Dazzle, a precompetition event for FLL teams to practice, and the Rochester Rumble, a postcompetition event for teams to reuse their robots. 
  * The team also hosts the Rochester Rally at Penfield High School, a preship event for all Rochester FIRST teams. From this event we ship 8-10 robots to the drayage facility every year. 
  * Mock Build Season: The team held a mock build season in Nomvember and December of 2009. The students were broken up into two groups, where both teams then had two hours to design a Vex robot to play the game "Vertigo", followed by 4 hours to build and program the robots, and finished with a competition between both of the robots. 


##  Robots

  * 2005 "TriplePlay" Robot was called "RhinoBot" and employed a six-wheel tank steering system with custom drive wheels. The lifting arm was created by using a [long high-speed rotary leadscrew](http://rollingthunder.smugmug.com/photos/18515084-S.jpg "http://rollingthunder.smugmug.com/photos/18515084-S.jpg" ).
