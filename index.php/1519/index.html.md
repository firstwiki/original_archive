## History

Team 1519 was formed primarily around a group of high school students who had
graduated from Mindstorms Mayhem, a FIRST LEGO League team that won the
Director's Award at the International Invitational in Atlanta, Georgia, in
April 2004. With this award came a challenge grant from The LEGO Group to
create an FRC team and compete in a regional competition in 2005. The
Mindstorms Mayhem team accepted the challenge and Mechanical Mayhem was born.

The team has drawn additional members from several backgrounds. There are two
graduates of the Mach 6 FLL team, a church-based team that has shared mutual
respect with the Mayhem FLL team since facing them head to head three times at
the 2002 New Hampshire State FLL tournament. Others have come through the
homeschool network or from local high schools currently without a FIRST team.
