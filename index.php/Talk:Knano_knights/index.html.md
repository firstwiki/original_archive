section: Concerns" )]

##  Concerns

I have a few questions about this article that I would like to bring up.

  * Is this an article for a team? (FLL?) There is very little indication of it. 
  * Is the bit about "What is FIRST?" really necessary? It seems like a redirect to the [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) article would be more appropriate. 
  * The article looks like a report that a team would use for the research part of competition. You might want to consider making it more encyclopedic. 
  * Also, the "Team's Favorite Websites" section should be removed as it is completely out of place and irrelevant to the FIRSTwiki. 

  
All and all, you have some good information, it just needs to be formatted
properly. I'd help you myself but this seems to be one of the articles that
FIRSTwiki won't let me edit for some reason (The dreaded edit glitch strikes
again; time to talk to a site admin). [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000
