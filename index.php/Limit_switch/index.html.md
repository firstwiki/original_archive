A **limit switch** is a [digital](digital)
[sensor](sensor). It has a value of _open_ or _closed_,
i.e., whether or not the switch lever has been hit to depress the switch on
the sensor. It can be wired as _normally open (NO)_ or _normally closed (NC)_
to change how the values are interpreted.

On the [Robot Controller](robot-controller) a
closed switch gives a 0 while an open switch gives a 1.
