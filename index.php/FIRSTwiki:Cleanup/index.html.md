Articles that need an extensive cleanup should be placed here. See [Wikipedia:Cleanup](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleanup "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Cleanup") for more information.

Basically, if the article isn't quite a stub, but it is in need of more content, a re-wording, or even just a structural adjustment, it should be placed here. Those FIRSTwikians who prefer to be editors can then go through this list and make their contributions to those pages that are most in need of help. This **should not** be a [list of stubs](http://www.firstwiki.org/index.
php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&target=Template%3AStub "http://www.firstwiki.o
rg/index.php?title=Special:Whatlinkshere&target=Template%3AStub"). See also, [What to contribute](FIRSTwiki:What_to_contribute "FIRSTwiki:What
to contribute").

_Note that articles in the general namespace should be put here, not meta pages._

## 2011

- [Machining](Machining "Machining") could use some pictures, the section on milling, and basically more information. It would be really nice if a mentor with machining experience could go through this and vet the information.

### June 30

- [Creating a Forum](Creating_a_Forum "Creating a Forum") does not follow naming convention, tutorial for specific board is inappropriate, maybe detail several options availalbe (and don't forget Yahoo! groups), and link to other tutorials if necessary (see talk page too)

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Cleanup&action=edit&section=8 "Edit
section: June 28")]

### June 28

- [Team organization](Team_organization "Team organization") structure, organized into headings, formatting issues (bold title, headers, fix link, etc.), maybe explain general team organization and have separate pages for certain specific teams, e.g., [Team organization (128)](/index.php?title=Team_organization_%28128%29&action=edit "Team organization \(128\)")

  - began rewrite. I think the option for a team organization page should be included in [FIRSTwiki:team page format](FIRSTwiki:Team_page_format "FIRSTwiki:Team page format"). Sorta unrelated, but maybe the name scheme for team pages should be something like "<team number> thing" because the team is the primary index, no the fact that it is a "thing" page. So in this case, [128 Team organization](/index.php?title=128_Team_organization&action=edit "128 Team organization"). --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 15:13, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)
  - I disagree. If some hypothetical user is looking up team organization, references to how other teams do it is more than appropriate and very relevent. However, if the same hypothetical user is looking up team XXXX, how they organize their team is typically only of minor relevance. Also, the "group" of team organization pages are more related to each other in that they are about organization than that they are about a certain team number, hence the greater binding relation should take precedence. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 15:21, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)

### June 27

- [Championship Event (1993)](Championship_Event_%281993%29 "Championship Event \(1993\)") dead end page, needs links describing game, a comment on where the championship occurred would be in order to, plus links to history
