Screenshot of one instance of the "uneditable glitch." Shown using Windows
Internet Explorer.  
  
Due to an apparent glitch in MediaWiki software, some FIRSTwiki articles have
the **"uneditable glitch."** Some users have expressed problems due to an
apparent glitch that prevents them from editing certain articles on FIRSTwiki.
To help come up with a solution to this problem, this page will be used to
allow users to put articles that have not been able to edit on a list below.
Please note that the pages below may still be able to be edited by some
members, they are on the list because an individual user has had a problem
editing it.

  
If there was a change you were trying to make to one of these pages and have
been unable to, feel free to post a request in the talk page, so that another
user who isn't experiencing the problem can make any changes you need.

  
If you have experienced a glitch that has prevented you from editing a page,
please add that page to the list below. Also add the **{{FIRSTwiki
uneditable}}** tag anywhere in the article you are adding (if the page allows
you to, provided the glitch doesn't disallow it).
