**Logo Motion** is the 2011 [FIRST Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics Competition" ) game. Playing pieces are inner tubes shaped like the components of the [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) logo. The primary objective of the game is to place them on racks to gain points. In the endgame, robots deploy smaller robots ("minibots") to climb a tower. Minibots must be made from the [FIRST Tech Challenge](/index.php/FIRST_Tech_Challenge "FIRST Tech Challenge" ) kit of parts. The game celebrates the 20th season of the FRC and is also meant to commemorate the artist [Jack Kamen](/index.php/Jack_Kamen "Jack Kamen" ), who designed the original FIRST logo.

Kickoff" )]

## Kickoff

The kickoff, the first event of the 2011 FRC season, was held at the Southern
New Hampshire University and simulcast to numerous regional kickoffs
throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Speakers included Walt
Havenstein, Jon Dudas, [Dean Kamen](/index.php/Dean_Kamen "Dean Kamen" ),
[Neal Bascomb](/index.php?title=Neal_Bascomb&action=edit "Neal Bascomb" ),
Amir Abo-Shaeer, [Dave Lavery](/index.php/Dave_Lavery "Dave Lavery" ) and
Will.I.Am. It was broadcast live on NASA TV starting at 10:30 EST.

As per previous years' competitions, Dave Lavery produced and narrated the
official game animation video. New Hampshire businessman and FIRST official
Blair Hundertmark assisted in the production of the video.

## Rules


### Match periods

A match is 135 seconds long.

  * **Autonomous** \- first 15 seconds. Code on the robots is remotely activated, and robots may react to sensor inputs and commands programmed into the robot's onboard control system. The robot tries to score Ubertubes onto pegs on the scoring grid. 
  * **Teleoperated** \- final 120 seconds. Humans using a console drive their robots around the field, trying to score points using any game piece. 
    * **Endgame** \- final 10 seconds. Minibots may be deployed onto the towers to score extra points. They may only be deployed during this period. 

[[edit](/index.php?title=Logo_Motion&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section:
Alliances" )]

### Alliances

As per previous years' competitions, three teams are on each alliance, red and
blue. Each team may have one robot on the field. That robot may be remotely
controlled by a driver after the autonomous period.


### Field

)

[![Enlarge](/skins/common/images/magnify-

LogoMotion field

As per previous years' competitions, the playing field is 27-feet by 54-feet.
The floor consists of gray carpet. On each end of the field, there are scoring
grids, immediately in front of the alliance stations, where the robots are
remotely controlled by drivers. Each alliance station is protected by a wall,
known as the alliance wall. On each alliance wall, there are two scoring
grids. Each scoring grid has 9 pegs arranged like a square. Each row is 37
inches above the next, except on the outside columns in each grid, where the
bottom peg is only 30 inches above the ground. There are openings in the
alliance wall, called _feeding slots_, in every corner, where an alliance
member may enter playing pieces into play. However, to get from the scoring
grid to your alliance's feeding slot, you must transverse the field. There are
towers in the middle of the field, with a cylindrical base. The towers are
used in the endgame for alliances to earn up 30 points. To assist teams in
driving and programming a robot through almost completely open field, there is
colored tape on the floor to allow for sensor calibration and to create visual
reference points. Furthermore, the tape delineates area where certain robots
may or may not traverse.


### Playing pieces

  * **Ubertube** \- a yellow, circular inner tube. It may only be used during the autonomous period. 
  * **Minibot** \- an [FTC](/index.php/FIRST_Tech_Challenge "FIRST Tech Challenge" ) robot 

The following make up the FIRST Logo.

  * **Triangle** \- a red, triangular inner tube 
  * **Circle** \- a white, circular inner tube 
  * **Square** \- a blue, square inner tube 


### Scoring

The following is a scoring chart for the Ubertube as they are hung on the end
field walls, during the autonomous period.

On bottom row |  2 Points  
---|---  
On middle row |  4 Points  
On top row |  6 Points  
  
The following is a scoring chart for the game pieces as they are hung on the
end field walls, during tele-operated mode (human remote controlled period).
Any tube that is part of a non-Ubertube triangle-circle-square group
(depicting the FIRST logo) is worth double of the listed points.

Logo Piece |  Alone |  Over Ubertube  
---|---|---  
NOT Hanging |  0 Points |  0 Points  
Hanging on Bottom Row |  1 Point |  2 Points  
Hanging on Middle Row |  2 Points|  4 Points  
Hanging on Top Row |  3 Points |  6 Points  
  
The following is a scoring chart for the mini-bot, a smaller
[FTC](/index.php/FIRST_Tech_Challenge "FIRST Tech Challenge" ) robot deployed
during the end game period. The end game is a race between four mini bots to
reach the top of tower pole on the field.

1st mini-bot to reach the top |  30 Points  
---|---  
2nd mini-bot to reach the top |  20 Points  
3rd mini-bot to reach the top |  15 Points  
4th mini-bot to reach the top |  10 Points  
  
Based on the information above, the number of points an alliance may score is
capped at 158, as game pieces may not be de-scored.

Robots" )]

### Robots

Robot rules are similar to other years with the exception of the minibot. A
notable difference is that while a robot must start the match within
38"x28"x60", it may expand to a 84" diameter cylinder with no height
constraints.&lt;ref name="FRC 2011 manual"/&gt;
