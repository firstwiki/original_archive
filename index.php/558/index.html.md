## History

In the early years, the team was run as part of a physics class. A few years
later, it became an after school program and the team was given a workroom in
the school's basement. Thus our team's slogan was born: "From the basement to
beyond.‚Äù

In 2006, after finishing as a finalist at the UTC Connecticut Regional, the
team was rewarded with a new, larger work space on the school's main floor,
making its slogan a reality and truly moving the team "from the basement to
beyond."

Currently, the team is made up of 25 extremely dedicated and diverse students
and seven mentors. The team's sponsors are varied as well and include the New
Haven public school system, a local university, a community foundation and
numerous area businesses.

The team has been the recipient of many awards, including the 2007 UTC
Connecticut Regional Daimler-Chrysler Team Spirit Award, the 2005 UTC
Connecticut Regional Imagery Award and the 2003 UTC Connecticut Regional
Judge's Award. The team also was a winner at the 2007 UTC New England Regional
in an alliance with teams from Southington and Avon. This qualified the team
to attend the 2007 Championship Event in Atlanta, GA, where the team finished
15th out of 87 robots in the Curie Division and was selected as a quarter
finalist.
