## History

In the early years, the team was run as part of a physics class. A few years later, it became an after school program and the team was given a workroom in the school's basement. Thus our team's slogan was born: "From the basement to beyond."

In 2006, after finishing as a finalist at the UTC Connecticut Regional, the team was rewarded with a new, larger work space on the school's main floor, making its slogan a reality and truly moving the team "from the basement to beyond."

Currently, the team is made up of 25 extremely dedicated and diverse students and seven mentors. The team's sponsors are varied as well and include the New Haven public school system, a local university, a community foundation and numerous area businesses.

The team has been the recipient of many awards, including the 2007 UTC Connecticut Regional Daimler-Chrysler Team Spirit Award, the 2005 UTC Connecticut Regional Imagery Award and the 2003 UTC Connecticut Regional Judge's Award. The team also was a winner at the 2007 UTC New England Regional in an alliance with teams from Southington and Avon. This qualified the team to attend the 2007 Championship Event in Atlanta, GA, where the team finished 15th out of 87 robots in the Curie Division and was selected as a quarter finalist.
