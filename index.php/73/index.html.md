## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

2004 is the team's second year with Bausch &amp; Lomb (B&amp;L) and the team
consists of some 50 persons from B&amp;L, Edison and RIT. This breaks down to
three Edison teachers, about 25 Edison students, 13 B&amp;L staff, 10 RIT
students and 2 RIT staff.

Team #73 was started in 1993 as the Ediaks with Eastman Kodak Company as the
sponsor. In 1995, Harris Corporation took over as sponsor. Students from the
Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) special interest dormitory Engineering
House, supported by staff from the College of Engineering joined the team in
1996. The team name was changed to Tigerbolt to represent Harris' focus on
electronics, Edison's logo (the thunderbolt) and RIT's mascot (the tiger). The
RIT students assisted this unique partnership by helping to bridge the gap
between the high school students and the technical professionals.
Additionally, the college students could directly show the relevance between
the high school classes and college coursework.

Team Tigerbolt won the national championship in 1996 and was voted most
photogenic in the mid-Atlantic regional and national competitions in 1997.
Unfortunately business conditions forced the team's sponsor to discontinue
their support and the team was dissolved.

In the fall of 2000, a group of RIT Engineering honors freshmen, also veterans
of FIRST, set out to rejuvenate the team. In the true spirit or partnership,
funds were raised from Alstom Transportation, Alstom Employees Foundation,
Fibertech Networks, New York State Department of Education Science and
Technology Entry Program, RIT College of Engineering, RIT Department of
Enrollment Management, and the Rochester City School District. This team
competed in the mid- Atlantic regionals and nationals in 2001 and won a Judges
award at the regional.

Due to more financial difficulties, Team #73 didn't compete in 2002.

In the spring of 2002, Bausch &amp; Lomb (B&amp;L) agreed to be the corporate
sponsor for Team #73. During the summer and fall of 2002, staff from B&amp;L,
Edison and RIT met to plan for team operations. The team name was changed to
the Visioneers to acknowledge B&amp;L's leadership position in vision
products.

This team has made significant progress on one of the goals of FIRST, the
involvement of underrepresented student groups. In 2002-03, a partnership was
established with the RIT North Star Center to create a research project for a
Packaging Science student to build the shipping crate for the robot. Technical
support was provided by a faculty member in the packaging science department
and supported by funds from the New York State Department of Education
Collegiate Science and Technology Program (CSTEP).
