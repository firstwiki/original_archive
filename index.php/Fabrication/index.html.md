**Fabrication** refers to the actual building of the [robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ). Prior to fabrication, the robot must be [conceptualized](/index.php?title=Analyzing_the_game&action=edit "Analyzing the game" ) and [designed](/index.php?title=Designing_the_robot&action=edit "Designing the robot" ). Once the robot is fabricated, it must be [programmed](/index.php/Programming "Programming" ). 

[Teams](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics Team" ) are given six
weeks to build the robot, during which the [entire
process](/index.php?title=Entire_process&action=edit "Entire process" ) \--
from brainstorming to implementation and ultimately testing -- must take
place. There are several guidelines to building the robot. Each team starts
with the same [kit of parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) and must
follow the rules of the specific [game](/index.php/FRC_Games "FRC Games" ).

Phases" )]

# Phases

Fabrication is divided into several phases, beginning with the arrival of raw
[materials](/index.php?title=Materials&action=edit "Materials" ) and
[COTS](/index.php?title=COTS&action=edit "COTS" ) parts.

[[edit](/index.php?title=Fabrication&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section:
Machining" )]

## Machining

During the [machining](/index.php?title=Machining&action=edit "Machining" )
process, the parts for the robot are created from raw materials. This phases
involves [cutting](/index.php?title=Cutting&action=edit "Cutting" ),
[drilling](/index.php?title=Drilling&action=edit "Drilling" ),
[milling](/index.php/Mill "Mill" ), or [turning](/index.php/Lathe "Lathe" ).
Parts are often machined from sketches or CAD drawings. Common
[materials](/index.php?title=Materials&action=edit "Materials" ) include
[aluminum](/index.php/Aluminum "Aluminum" ), [steel](/index.php/Steel "Steel"
), [polycarbonate](/index.php/Polycarbonate "Polycarbonate" ), and
[polyethylene](/index.php?title=Polyethylene&action=edit "Polyethylene" ).

[[edit](/index.php?title=Fabrication&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section:
Assembly" )]

## Assembly

During the assembly phase, the parts of the robot, including machined parts
and COTS parts are assembled. Most parts require some kind of
[fastener](/index.php?title=Fasteners&action=edit "Fasteners" ), but other
methods of assembly include [welding](/index.php/Welding "Welding" ),
[adhesives](/index.php?title=Adhesives&action=edit "Adhesives" ), and [snap-
in](/index.php?title=Snap-in&action=edit "Snap-in" ) parts.
