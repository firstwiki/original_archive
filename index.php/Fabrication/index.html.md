**Fabrication** refers to the actual building of the [robot](robot). Prior to fabrication, the robot must be [conceptualized](/index.php?title=Analyzing_the_game&action=edit "Analyzing the game") and [designed](/index.php?title=Designing_the_robot&action=edit "Designing the robot"). Once the robot is fabricated, it must be [programmed](programming).

[Teams](FIRST_Robotics_Team "FIRST Robotics Team") are given six weeks to build the robot, during which the [entire process](/index.php?title=Entire_process&action=edit "Entire process") -- from brainstorming to implementation and ultimately testing -- must take place. There are several guidelines to building the robot. Each team starts with the same [kit of parts](kit-of-parts) and must follow the rules of the specific [game](FRC_Games "FRC Games").

# Phases

Fabrication is divided into several phases, beginning with the arrival of raw [materials](/index.php?title=Materials&action=edit "Materials") and [COTS](/index.php?title=COTS&action=edit "COTS") parts.

## Machining

During the [machining](/index.php?title=Machining&action=edit "Machining") process, the parts for the robot are created from raw materials. This phases involves [cutting](/index.php?title=Cutting&action=edit "Cutting"), [drilling](/index.php?title=Drilling&action=edit "Drilling"), [milling](Mill "Mill"), or [turning](Lathe "Lathe"). Parts are often machined from sketches or CAD drawings. Common [materials](/index.php?title=Materials&action=edit "Materials") include [aluminum](Aluminum "Aluminum"), [steel](Steel "Steel"), [polycarbonate](Polycarbonate "Polycarbonate"), and [polyethylene](/index.php?title=Polyethylene&action=edit "Polyethylene").

## Assembly

During the assembly phase, the parts of the robot, including machined parts and COTS parts are assembled. Most parts require some kind of [fastener](/index.php?title=Fasteners&action=edit "Fasteners"), but other methods of assembly include [welding](Welding "Welding"), [adhesives](/index.php?title=Adhesives&action=edit "Adhesives"), and [snap- in](/index.php?title=Snap-in&action=edit "Snap-in") parts.
