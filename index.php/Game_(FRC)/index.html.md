A FRC game is a game involving the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ).

Each year the game is structurally different from previous years in remarkable
ways. [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) strives to present a visually
stimulating game for spectators, a game interesting for the participants,
challenging for [veteran teams](/index.php/Veteran_teams "Veteran teams" ),
yet accessible to [rookie teams](/index.php/Rookie_teams "Rookie teams" ).
This is never an easy balance to reach, but FIRST is known for suprising
innovations; features such as [autonomous mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode
"Autonomous mode" ), the bins of [Stack Attack](/index.php/Stack_Attack "Stack
Attack" ), and the stairs in [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the
Bar](/index.php/FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"
) show just how clever [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) can be.


## The Game

Usually the [FRC](/index.php/FRC "FRC" ) game contains of two alliances (red
and blue) each with three robots on the alliance. The game also usually
contains a game element and a goal object.

## Kickoff

Each year in early January, [kickoffs](/index.php/Kickoff "Kickoff" ) are held
nationwide as [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) releases the design of the
current year's game. This begins what is known as the [build
season](/index.php/Build_season "Build season" ) and the six week countdown
clock until the robot must be shipped begins.
