A FRC game is a game involving the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ).

Each year the game is structurally different from previous years in remarkable
ways. [FIRST](first) strives to present a visually
stimulating game for spectators, a game interesting for the participants,
challenging for [veteran teams](Veteran_teams "Veteran teams" ),
yet accessible to [rookie teams](Rookie_teams "Rookie teams" ).
This is never an easy balance to reach, but FIRST is known for suprising
innovations; features such as [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode
"Autonomous mode" ), the bins of [Stack Attack](Stack_Attack "Stack
Attack" ), and the stairs in [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the
Bar](FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar"
) show just how clever [FIRST](first) can be.


## The Game

Usually the [FRC](FRC "FRC" ) game contains of two alliances (red
and blue) each with three robots on the alliance. The game also usually
contains a game element and a goal object.


### Game Periods

Each [FRC](FRC "FRC" ) typically contains two main periods and
occasionally a third period within the last main period.

  * [Autonomous Period](Autonomous_Period "Autonomous Period" )
  * [Teleoperated Period](Teleoperated_Period "Teleoperated Period" )
    * [End Game](End_Game "End Game" )


## Kickoff

Each year in early January, [kickoffs](Kickoff "Kickoff" ) are held
nationwide as [FIRST](first) releases the design of the
current year's game. This begins what is known as the [build
season](Build_season "Build season" ) and the six week countdown
clock until the robot must be shipped begins.
