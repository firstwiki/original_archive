A FRC game is a game involving the [FIRST Robotics Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition").

Each year the game is structurally different from previous years in remarkable ways. [FIRST](first) strives to present a visually stimulating game for spectators, a game interesting for the participants, challenging for [veteran teams](Veteran_teams "Veteran teams"), yet accessible to [rookie teams](Rookie_teams "Rookie teams"). This is never an easy balance to reach, but FIRST is known for suprising innovations; features such as [autonomous mode](autonomous-mode), the bins of [Stack Attack](Stack_Attack "Stack
Attack"), and the stairs in [FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar](FIRST_Frenzy:_Raising_the_Bar "FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar") show just how clever [FIRST](first) can be.

## The Game

Usually the [FRC](FRC "FRC") game contains of two alliances (red and blue) each with three robots on the alliance. The game also usually contains a game element and a goal object.

### Game Periods

Each [FRC](FRC "FRC") typically contains two main periods and occasionally a third period within the last main period.

- [Autonomous Period](Autonomous_Period "Autonomous Period")
- [Teleoperated Period](Teleoperated_Period "Teleoperated Period")

  - [End Game](End_Game "End Game")

## Kickoff

Each year in early January, [kickoffs](kickoff) are held nationwide as [FIRST](first) releases the design of the current year's game. This begins what is known as the [build season](Build_season "Build season") and the six week countdown clock until the robot must be shipped begins.
