## Team projects

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Legos: A
Girl's Favorite Toy" )]

### Legos: A Girl's Favorite Toy

The team helped the University of Michigan's Women in Science and Engineering
(WISE) with the establishment of a Lego League team composed of middle school
girls from Washtenaw County, providing funding, mentorship, and spirit for the
team.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Helping the
Hungry" )]

### Helping the Hungry

The team collected canned goods for Food Gatherers, an organization which
provides food to the needy.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Making a
Mark at Mott" )]

### Making a Mark at Mott

The Rat Pack hosted a Robot Day in cooperation with the University of
Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital. This program allowed patients to
interact with the team and their peers in a fun and educational setting using
Lego Mindstorm kits.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Pfun with
Pfizer: SAMJAM" )]

### Pfun with Pfizer: SAMJAM

Every year, Pfizer holds SAMJAM, the Science and Math Jamboree. This event
teaches middle school students about the world around them, from demonstrating
how one's eyes work to showing how robots work in a pharmaceutical laboratory.
Team 830 showed children how they can take the FIRST step towards the careers
in technology with multiple 15-minute robot demonstrations.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Mission
Possible" )]

### Mission Possible

The team held a summer day camp in 2003 to help promote the importance of
technology with a fun, interactive environment. Middle schoolers formed teams
with high school mentors, and over the course of the camp, they were
challenged to effectively create a balloon-popping robot that used only the
parts in one Mindstorms kit and one small needle.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Continuing
the Tradition of Sally Ride" )]

### Continuing the Tradition of Sally Ride

The Rat Pack took part in the Sally Ride Science Festival, an event on the
University of Michigan's engineering campus with the purpose of instilling the
value of science and math in girls currently in elementary and middle school.
During this, the team spoke to the girls and their parents about the goal of
FIRST, and allowed them to strap on their safety glasses and operate the 2005
robot's appendage.

[[edit](/index.php?title=830&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section:
UMentorFIRST" )]

### UMentorFIRST

During the autumn months, UMentorFIRST, the Rat Pack's mentor base from the
University of Michigan, hosted ten after-school technical workshops for the
Rat Pack. These workshops included topics such as drivetrain and appendage
design, electronics, CAD, programming, and machining.
