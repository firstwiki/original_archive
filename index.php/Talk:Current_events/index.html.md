LOL. Why is May 28 and 2004 referenceing something?

Is there a need for a current events page? This seems to me to be the area
where ChiefDelphi would be more appropriate. I can see maybe we want to
archive the history of it here ... but something important enough would likely
get its own page, no? If we want to keep the page, we should definately come
up with guidelines of what is "newsworthy" ... keep it updated ... and give it
a home (currently it is orphaned). (A link from the main page would be best, I
imagine, if we clean it up ...) --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls

    I definitley think there is a need. It does server as a history. Like many other pages, it is just another way of organizing data, but it is still important. I suspect when there are actually a significant number of current events, we may actually make a guideline. I don't really think the Riemann Hypothesis thing is appropriate, but it doesn't matter because the page is pretty useless, now. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:03, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    Yeah, I was thinking it over, and perhaps I do see a need for it during the actual pre-season/build season/competition season time frame. But summer news would be a bit slow, and so we should probably have headings like **Build season**, **Regional sason**, **Summer**, etc. And just list the dates in bold, then mention the specific news. Just a suggestion -- I suppose we'll have to wait till we have news to see what will work and what looks good. So far as the RH goes ... how can you say that pure mathematics/analytical number theory has no place here? We don't want the people coming here to think there's nothing in life besides FIRST -- I mean, there's a whole mathematical world out there, just waiting to have all sorts of conjectures and hypotheses proven. (Actually, I was hoping to generate some discussion in this page. See, it worked.)  ;) --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:10, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    

    I'm not sure exactly how much was sarcastic (tone of voice is kinda lost without a voice), so I'll respond: there is probably room in FIRSTwiki to have a page including stuff just "interesting" to FIRSTers, but there definitley should be a different page concerning FIRST specific stuff. A history of sports won't include WWII even though I'm really sure it was pretty big in most people's lives (well maybe professional players getting drafted or something, but you see my point.) Anyway, I'm not sure if such a page with anything of interest should be kept organized like this one, maybe just a "chit-chat" page open to all non-FIRST/FIRSTwiki stuff. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:16, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)

##  Needs Work

This needs to improved and updated. January is almost up and there is almost
nothing on this page. You need to add photos or something to make it more
appeaking to the eye.
