# Tournament alliance

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Tournament alliancs** are chosen before the [elimination matches](/index.php/Elimination_match "Elimination match" ) when the top 8 (or 16) [seeded](/index.php/Seed "Seed" ) [teams](/index.php/Team "Team" ) pick two partners each, creating 8 (or 16) alliances of 3 teams each. The procedure for picking alliances can change and is outlined in the [rules](/index.php?title=Rules&action=edit "Rules" ). In addition, when playing [elimination matches](/index.php/Elimination_match "Elimination match" ), all of the 3 teams in an alliance may not play every game, and this depends on the year's [rules](/index.php?title=Rules&action=edit "Rules" ) also.
