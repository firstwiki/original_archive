# Tournament alliance

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Tournament alliancs** are chosen before the [elimination matches](Elimination_match "Elimination match") when the top 8 (or 16) [seeded](Seed "Seed") [teams](team) pick two partners each, creating 8 (or 16) alliances of 3 teams each. The procedure for picking alliances can change and is outlined in the [rules](/index.php?title=Rules&action=edit "Rules"). In addition, when playing [elimination matches](Elimination_match "Elimination match"), all of the 3 teams in an alliance may not play every game, and this depends on the year's [rules](/index.php?title=Rules&action=edit "Rules") also.
