## History

  * Montclair Robotics is the FIRST robotics team at Montclair High School in Montclair, New Jersey. Our primary, co-ed team is 555, but it was joined last year by the all-girls team, 1929. We are sponsored by Josh &amp; Judy Weston, MFEE, Montclair Society of Engineers, and Montclair Board of Education. In 2005, we competed in two regionals, winning the Phoenix, Arizona regional and finishing as a finalist in the New York City regional, where we also won the web site award and the sportsmanship award. We competed in the championship in Atlanta, where we won the international sportsmanship award. We have a hard-working, dedicated team of students in all high school grades. Our two advisors, Monique Dituri, Chemistry teacher and Michael Barouch, Auto shop and Digital Electronics teacher, with assistance from our two captains, Ben (Bob) Karas and Dan Spiers (senior and junior, respectively).
