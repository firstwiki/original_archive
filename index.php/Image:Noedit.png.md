Screenshot of one instance of the "uneditable glitch." Shown using Windows Internet Explorer.

Due to an apparent glitch in MediaWiki software, some FIRSTwiki articles have the **"uneditable glitch."** Some users have expressed problems due to an apparent glitch that prevents them from editing certain articles on FIRSTwiki. To help come up with a solution to this problem, this page will be used to allow users to put articles that have not been able to edit on a list below. Please note that the pages below may still be able to be edited by some members, they are on the list because an individual user has had a problem editing it.

If there was a change you were trying to make to one of these pages and have been unable to, feel free to post a request in the talk page, so that another user who isn't experiencing the problem can make any changes you need.

If you have experienced a glitch that has prevented you from editing a page, please add that page to the list below. Also add the **{{FIRSTwiki uneditable}}** tag anywhere in the article you are adding (if the page allows you to, provided the glitch doesn't disallow it).
