# Talk:Using MPLAB

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Okay, given that I think what is there should be moved to [Using MPLAB](Using_MPLAB "Using MPLAB") with a link on the Howto pages, I'll give some sample content on what could go in this article. So tell me what you think ... --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 16:29, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT)

_To learn how to use MPLAB, see [Using MPLAB](Using_MPLAB "Using
MPLAB")._

**MPLAB** is the name of the free Windows program that is used to edit, compile, and debug programs. The software comes with the [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts") or with the [Robovation](robovation) kit. Programs are written in C typically, but assembly can be put inline as well. MPLAB is the offical IDE (interative design environment) offered by [Microchip](Microchip "Microchip"), but other editors can be used just the same. However, it is important to compile the programs using MPLAB (or some equivalent) to generate the [HEX files](/index.php?title=HEX_files&action=edit "HEX files") needed for [IFI loader](IFI_loader "IFI loader"), the program that [downloads](Downloading_a_program "Downloading a program") the program to the [robot controller](robot-controller).

the FRC"), [Software](Software "Software")

## Resources

- links to 60 day trial of MPLAB
- IFI's doc page (programming tools section)
- and Compiler User's guide
- (maybe more) to come ... later

(Maybe talk about some of the quirks that really bug me about MPLAB, or leave that to its own article, or put it in Using MPLAB... probably the last is more appropriate.)

Definitley agreed, It definitley is not appropriate to have a command-bye- command explanation of a program in a page with the program's name. Imagine [3D Studio MAX](/index.php?title=3D_Studio_MAX&action=edit "3D Studio MAX")

```
Ok, go ahead and set it up however you want. I'll move to working this on whatever page it ends up on. :) --[Texan](User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 17:50, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Maybe this should be divided into an article describing what MPLAB is, and another structured as a howto on Getting to know MPLAB? --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 15:04, 6 Jun 2004 (EDT)

```
Well what is there to say about what it is? 1 paragraph tops. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:06, 6 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

He's right. It's the official IDE, it comes on a CD, a 60-day trial is available. Anything else? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 21:57, 6 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



If I've never heard of MPLAB and some article mentions it, I will click the link to find out more ... I would expect a brief article describing it. Anything on how many menu options there are would be irrelevent. Likewise, if I've heard of it but want to figure out how to use it, I would go to a howto article ... and an introduction about what it is wouldn't be relavent, and just distract from what I want. _What MPLAB is_ is logically separate from _How to use MPLAB_ \-- merely because you feel content is lacking in the former doesn't mean they should be combined. The two, can of course, link to each other ... but hey, [encoder](Encoder "Encoder" ) doesn't have a lot of information right now ... should we go ahead and include some info on how to make one just to flesh it out a bit? No, because that stands to confuse readers and combines what is logically separate. Or that's the way I see it, anyway. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 10:59, 7 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



Your right, but the name of of the article is MPLAB. In the article, we should be able to include anything that relates to MPLAB. Agree? 

Well we have an article named FIRST Robotics Team. Should information on how to start a FRC team be included -- since it falls under the umbrella of "anything that relates to" a FIRST Robotics Team? No, it obviously deserves its own article. Really, we have an article on [FIRST](first) \-- should everything we have be flattened out and stuffed in that article, just because they relate? No. Lots of things relate, that's why we typically use wiki links in-between most articles. The only way to be able to manage all of it and find what we are looking for, though, is to separate it logically. Is there any actual reason as to why an article on How to use MPLAB belongs in MPLAB, besides concerns over space? Don't get me wrong, I think it is a very useful article that deserves mention here ... but they are clearly two separate articles. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 15:24, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 







I see what you are saying, but what do we put in _this_ article then? There isn't much to say about MPLAB. --[Texan](User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 07:05, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
```

Also, do you think that the menus should be in their own separate sections (easily accessible by the table of contents) or in a giant list that reflects the nesting well? (sorry fpr the menus Mrawls...) I'm planning on using the diffent menu items as a way to break into different parts of MPLAB, but if you don't like it, say so. --[Texan](User:Texan "User:Texan") 18:01, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT)

```
The descriptions should be added, though. If I don't have MPLAB, I don't care. If I do, I can see what menu items are available by opening MPLAB. Make something useful out of the list. 

Yeah, I know. I just started that list. I'm planning on getting descriptions up about everything soon. It took a while just to get all that in... --[Texan](User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 15:16, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
