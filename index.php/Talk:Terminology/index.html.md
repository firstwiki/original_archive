# Talk:Terminology

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

I definitley see the usefulness and possibility of a terminology page with
terminology specific to FIRST, but if its going to contain all technical terms
that might be involved in FIRST, it is definitley impossible, not useful, and
therefore a waste of time. Unless the author can explain the purpose of this
page a bit better, I will suggest it for deletion. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max

    I agree. Tx and Rx should be Wikipedia links, not local. If noone can come up with FIRST specific terms, this page (and [TX](/index.php/TX "TX" ) and [RX](/index.php/RX "RX" ) should be deleted) --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 21:34, 23 Sep 2004 (EDT)
