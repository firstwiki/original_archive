# Talk:Terminology

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

I definitley see the usefulness and possibility of a terminology page with terminology specific to FIRST, but if its going to contain all technical terms that might be involved in FIRST, it is definitley impossible, not useful, and therefore a waste of time. Unless the author can explain the purpose of this page a bit better, I will suggest it for deletion. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 21:53, 21 Sep 2004 (EDT)

I agree. Tx and Rx should be Wikipedia links, not local. If noone can come up with FIRST specific terms, this page (and [TX](TX "TX" ) and [RX](RX "RX" ) should be deleted) --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 21:34, 23 Sep 2004 (EDT)
