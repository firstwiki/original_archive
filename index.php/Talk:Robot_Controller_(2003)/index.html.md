Isn't PIC a Microchip thing? Parallax just calls it the BS2sx. (Oooops, It's the BS2**s**x, not BS2x!)--[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 11:46, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Why call it the "Full RC"? that isn't the name, and it is unneeded, there is only one FIRST robotics controller. There is the EDU controller, but that is called the EDU controller, moving back --[Max](User:Max "User:Max")

```
on second though, moving to 2003 [Robot controller](robot-controller ), to match the current one. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" )
```

Is there a legacy page for the 2003 RC like for the [EDU](EDU_Bot_%282003%29 "EDU Bot \(2003\)") and the [OI](Operator_interface_%282003%29 "Operator interface \(2003\)")? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 17:27, 1 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Wowsers! Yes, "PIC" is most definately a microchip thing. The BS2sx was called a Basic Stamp. Stamp, not PIC. (Actually, I have the Basic Stamp book with Kamen's sig on it ... maybe I should upload it?) Anyway, as for legacy documentation, did you check [the legacy documentation page](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/documentation-legacy.htm "http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/documentation-legacy.htm" )? (It's there, by the way.) --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 12:12, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I sort of ment besides that. Like for the [EDU](http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-rc-legacy.htm "http://www.innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-rc-legacy.htm" ) or the [OI](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-oi.htm "http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-oi.htm" ). --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 12:24, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I'm confused. There are at least 2 specific documents on that page you might look at, which include the information on the pages you cite, but relavent to the RC. What information are you looking for that isn't there? --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 12:39, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
The official IFI about the 2003 RC. It probably was there this time last year. But I can't find it now. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 12:52, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

IFI stands for Innovation First, Inc. I'm afraid I don't understand what you are referring to. But the legacy [RC Reference Guide](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Full_Size_Robot_Controller_Reference_Guide.pdf "http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/Full_Size_Robot_Controller_Reference_Guide.pdf" ) and [RC Installation Info](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/RobotControllerInstallationInfo.pdf "http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/pdfs/RobotControllerInstallationInfo.pdf" ) should provide the information you need, no? (It's woth mentioning that the OI page you reference is about the Edu OI. I don't think that's what is implied on the page [Operator Interface (2003)](Operator_Interface_%282003%29 "Operator Interface \(2003\)" ), though.) --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 13:03, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
