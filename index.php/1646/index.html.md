## History

_Lafayette Jeff Robotics was started in 2005 as an offshoot of 461 Boiler
Invasion because an assistant principle from Jefferson High School saw the
merit of the FIRST program and decided the school needed a team. Because of
the support of Mr. Francis, Team 1646 team has had the unique advantage of
attendance immunity during competitions since our inception. During that year,
Team 1646 was the highest seeded rookie at the Midwest Regional and earned the
Rookie All Star Award at the Boilermaker Regional. It was surely an exciting
first year for the team._

In 2006, the team decided to change its name from Lafayette Jeff Robotics to
Boiler Precision Guessworks. The team was quite successful and made it to the
semifinals at the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, Ohio.
