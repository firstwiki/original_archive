## Definition

An accelerometer is an electromechanical device that will measure acceleration
forces. These forces may be static, like the constant force of gravity pulling
at your feet, or they could be dynamic - caused by moving or vibrating the
accelerometer.

Uses" )]

## Uses

Some accelerometers use the piezoelectric effect - they contain microscopic
crystal structures that get stressed by accelerative forces, which causes a
voltage to be generated. Another way to do it is by sensing changes in
capacitance. If you have two microstructures next to each other, they have a
certain capacitance between them. If an accelerative force moves one of the
structures, then the capacitance will change. Add some circuitry to convert
from capacitance to voltage, and you will get an accelerometer. There are even
more methods, including use of the piezoresistive effect, hot air bubbles, and
light.

## Examples

Apple uses an LIS302DL accelerometer in the iPhone, iPod Touch and the 4th
generation iPod Nano allowing the device to know when it is tilted on its
side.

Apple's Sudden Motion Sensor, which is used to detect drops. If a drop is
detected, the heads of the hard disk are parked to avoid data loss by the
ensuing shock.  
The Wii Remote for the Wii game console contains a three-axis accelerometer
from Analog Devices to sense movement which complements its pointer
functionality. This provides more realistic game control.

## Types

• Capacitive - sense a change in capacitance related to acceleration  
[![](/media/thumb/9/92/CapacitaticeAccel.jpg/150px-
CapacitaticeAccel.jpg)](/index.php/Image:CapacitaticeAccel.jpg "" )  
• Piezoelectric - piezocrystal emits a charge when subjected to a "g" force,
mounted to mass–voltage output converted to acceleration  
[![](/media/thumb/d/d9/PiezoelectricAccel.jpg/150px-
PiezoelectricAccel.jpg)](/index.php/Image:PiezoelectricAccel.jpg "" )  
• Piezoresistive - uses a piezo-resistive substrate feature whose resistance
changes with acceleration

• Hall Effect -Motion converted to electrical signal by sensing of changing
magnetic fields
