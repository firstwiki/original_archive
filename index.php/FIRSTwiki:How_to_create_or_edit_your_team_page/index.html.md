# FIRSTwiki:How to create or edit your team page

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

If you are a member (or coach/mentor) of an FRC, FLL, or VEX team , one of the first things you may want to do is create or edit your team's page on FIRSTwiki. This tutorial/how-to will guide you through that process.

Note: If you are on an FLL team we also recommend that you see if your State or Local tournament page exists on FIRSTwiki. See [FIRSTwiki:How to create or edit an FLL event page](FIRSTwiki:How_to_create_or_edit_an_FLL_event_page "FIRSTwiki:How to create or edit an FLL event page") for a tutorial on that.

**Important:** We highly recommend that you first see if your team page already exists to avoid accidentally creating a new one. This is especially important for FLL where the team pages go by team name rather than team number. Use the links on the [Main page](Main_page "Main page") to search for your team by name or location.

### FRC Team

FIRST Team's go by team number so most team pages are already there. Start from the [Main page](Main_page "Main page") to find your team page, then check out the official page formats to see if your team's page adheres to the standard. If not, you may want to edit it according to those instructions.

### FLL Team

FLL Team's go by team name as FLL teams get a new team number every year. Some FLL teams also make up a new team name every year. If that applies to you, you may want to think about what name you want to use on FIRSTwiki. If you're ready to make your team page...

- View the [Step-by-Step Tutorial](FIRSTwiki:Create_Team_Page_Tutorial_%28FLL%29 "FIRSTwiki:Create Team Page Tutorial \(FLL\)") on how to create your team page.

### Vex Team

Vex Team's go by team number. Start from the [Main page](Main_page "Main page") to find your team page, then check out the official page formats to see if your team's page adheres to the standard. If not, you may want to edit it according to those instructions.
