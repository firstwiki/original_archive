## FTC

Why the hell is this still FVC? It is now officially FTC. Move this article,
because people said my article was improperly formatted, because it doesnt
have Vex next to the team, but this whole website is improperly updated.

  * Well, partly because not much information has been available regarding FTC. That, and there aren't a whole lot of people around here to make the nessesary changes. I could change the name (or move it or whatever) if someone else wants to rewrite it. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 15:24, 7 September 2007 (EDT) 

    

    Let's wait until September 19th to make that page [Czarbender](User:Czarbender "User:Czarbender" ) 04:12, 8 September 2007 (EDT) 

There's an official FTC article on wikipedia, i think that article should just
be copied over and archive this old article \--[Lyncas](User:Lyncas
