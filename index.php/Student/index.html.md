**Students** make up the core of a [FIRST Robotics team](FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team").

Students work with [mentors](Mentors "Mentors") and [engineers](Engineers "Engineers") to build a [robot](robot) for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](first). Students entering the program do not have to know anything about [building](Fabrication "Fabrication") robots; they can and are encouraged to learn as they go. To be a part of the FIRST program, they must be dedicated and willing to learn; most team's robots are entirely designed and built by the students, many of whom came in knowing nothing about robots at all.
