**Students** make up the core of a [FIRST Robotics team](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_team "FIRST Robotics team" ). 

Students work with [mentors](/index.php/Mentors "Mentors" ) and
[engineers](/index.php/Engineers "Engineers" ) to build a
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ) for the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). Students entering the program do not
have to know anything about [building](/index.php/Fabrication "Fabrication" )
robots; they can and are encouraged to learn as they go. To be a part of the
FIRST program, they must be dedicated and willing to learn; most team's robots
are entirely designed and built by the students, many of whom came in knowing
nothing about robots at all.
