## Team History

The Woodside Robotics team joined the FIRST robotics competition during 1995, becoming the first team on the west coast. The team number,100, is an easy one to remember. For many years, the Woodside Robotics team has invited students from different schools to join their team. Eventually, in 2003, a large group of students from Carlmont High School, a neighboring district school, joined the team. A decision was made and Team 100 became a multi-school team. In 2007, Sequoia High School, also in the same district, joined the team. Team 100 has historically sported very bright orange shirts and used a giant hat as their mascot.

## Team projects

In the past (2000-2001) the Woodside Robotics team had participated in the Sand Hill Challenge. Teams built "soap box cars" and competed for awards in design, creativity, and much more.

## Robots

**This section contains information or images relating to team robots and should be split into separate articles.**<br>
This section should be for providing links to the appropriate Team/Year page which is where robot information and images belong.<br>
See [FIRSTwiki:Page formats](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page

## formats" ) for more help.

- **2009** - 2009's robot was known as "Lunabeast" - Shotgun-like firing mechanism that could fire up to ten balls in under a second.
- **2008** - 2008's robot was known as "BallFrog" - 2 motor drive train powered by 2-speed AM "Super Shifters." Weighed aprox. 130 lbs. with battery. Used rollers to pick up the ball and cram it into the "Ball Cage." Ballfrog used an elevator to quickly hurdle or place balls for bonus points.
- **2007** - We named this years Rack 'n' Roll robot the "Tubesaurus Rex (T-Rex)" - 4 motor drive train powered by 2-speed AM shifting transmissions. 4' division, total weight (with bumpers and battery) was 130 lbs. We used the "sucker," which was able to suck up and rotate intertubes for placement on the rack. It could reach all three levels of the rack. We also built a second robot for practice before the competition; It was nicknamed "The Tubavore."
- **2006** - 6 motor, two speed, dog-shifting transmissions (each weighing about 9lbs with all motors and pneumatics attached -- 15fps high, 7 fps low). The drive was custom built and designed by team members and every gear was heat treated after machineing. 6 wheel drive, skid-steer layout. Incorporates a 1pt shooter that can also gather balls to load into a storage bin or be fed into the turret. The turret has a full 360* rotation and is guided by the CMU camera during autonomous mode. Due to weight and functionality difficulties, the turret was removed during the SVR Regional.
- **2005** - 2 module, 6 wheel swerve drive. The center sets of wheels were the swerve modules; the other wheels were omni wheels. The robot implemented a double-pivot arm, built from carbon-fiber [composite](Composite_Material "Composite Material") boards, which could cap the center goal.
- **2004** - Two-wheel/skid steer with rear castors. Each drive was powered by one CIM motor. Pneumatically operated arm mechanism, which was able to manipulate the 2x multiplier ball; when lowered it could be used as a corralling device. Incorporated a 2000lb towing capacity vehicle winch powered with a Bosch drill motor to lift the robot off the floor. A hook-extension mechanism was mounted on the arm which extended the robot's reach about 10'4" vertical reach and a 1-2' horizontal reach (extends to the left).
- **2003** - Four wheel/skid steer powered by Bosch motors with the stock Bosch gearboxes. Originally implemented a servo-based shifting device, but later was removed when it stalled during shifting. Had a swinging arm mechanism which when opened gave about a 9' wingspan; it lifted boxes by moving the arm's up and down via screw-drive.
- **2002** - Four wheel/skid steer powered by bosch motors with the stock Bosch gearboxes. Had pneumatically operated claws to manipulate the goals and a deployable 5th wheel powered by another Bosch motor, which gave extra pushing power.
- **1995** - Nicknamed "Stealth," our 1995 robot was able to quickly pick up balls in the "mosh pit" and carry them to the goal. It used a four wheel/skid-steer drivetrain powered by Bosch motors with the stock Bosch gearboxes. It also featured an unfolding claw that could grab the big ball and swing it over the top of the robot.

## Additional Team Facts

- Woodside High School was the first west coast high school to join the FIRST Robotics Competition (1995). Second to join was [PALY](8 "8").
- The 4-wheel-drive, dual drill motors, two speed, sprocket and chain drive that was last used in 2003 was a drive that has been used/developed by Team 100 since 1995 (Rookie Year).
- During the team's rookie year (1995) a professional battle 'bot builder helped to assist the team.
- Team 100 is one of five West coast teams to win Nationals; One of four teams to win Nationals (Epcot) alone.
- Team 100 is the only team to have become National Champions in their rookie year (not counting the 1992 champions).
- In 2002 Team 100 finished 53rd overall. The team would have been #1 in its division had they scored four more points in their last match.
- In 2002, they held the record for highest scoring match at SVR...with a robot that didn't function.
- Team 100 was a finalist at Cal Games for 4 straight years.
- With the exception of 2006, Woodside High school (our robot headquarters) has hosted the WRRF CAL Games.
- Team 100 earned the highest score at both the SVR and Davis/Sacramento Regionals in 2007
- Team 100 won multiple peer awards for our mascot, the dancing hat.
- In 2007 Team 100 played five quarterfinal matches at the Davis Regional: Loss, Tie, Win, Tie, Win
- In 2008 Team 100 played four semifinal matches at the Portland Regional: Win, Loss, Tie, Loss.
- In 2008 Team 100 played four matches in the Silicon Valley Regional Finals: Win, Loss, Undecided, Win. The last match was a rematch due to a controversial call by the referees. FIRST invited the finalists to the Championship as an apology for the controversy.
