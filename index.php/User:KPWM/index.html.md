## About Me

My name is Kevin Porter, currently a senior at Gorham High School in Maine. I have participated on [Team #172](Team#172 "Team") since the 2004/2005 season ([Triple Play](triple-play)) leading the Electrical/[Controls](control-system) team. More recently I have taken on a leadership role, representing the team at the High School, as well as dabbling in robot driving, mechanical and machining work, and other aspects of the team. While this is my last season with 172, I look forward to contributing from Embry Riddle Aeronautical university in the coming years (anyone from the ERAU sponsored team, if you'd like to contact me, it would be great to start getting to know people before I get down there for school next year!)<br>
...Finally, for those of you wondering about my user name, KPWM is the ICAO code for the Portland International Jetport, my hometown airport. Being a fan of aviation, I've adopted its name as my own. I can also be found on the English Language wikipedia as [KPWM_Spotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KPWM_Spotter "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KPWM_Spotter").
