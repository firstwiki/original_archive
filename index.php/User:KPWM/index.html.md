## About Me

My name is Kevin Porter, currently a senior at Gorham High School in Maine. I
have participated on [Team #172](/index.php/Team#172 "Team" ) since the
2004/2005 season ([Triple Play](/index.php/Triple_Play "Triple Play" ))
leading the Electrical/[Controls](/index.php/Control_system "Control system" )
team. More recently I have taken on a leadership role, representing the team
at the High School, as well as dabbling in robot driving, mechanical and
machining work, and other aspects of the team. While this is my last season
with 172, I look forward to contributing from Embry Riddle Aeronautical
university in the coming years (anyone from the ERAU sponsored team, if you'd
like to contact me, it would be great to start getting to know people before I
get down there for school next year!)  
...Finally, for those of you wondering about my user name, KPWM is the ICAO
code for the Portland International Jetport, my hometown airport. Being a fan
of aviation, I've adopted its name as my own. I can also be found on the
English Language wikipedia as
[KPWM_Spotter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KPWM_Spotter
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KPWM_Spotter" ).
