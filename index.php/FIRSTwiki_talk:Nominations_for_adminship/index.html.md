## Anonymos User edits

Since anonymos users are not allowed to vote/nominate, should we restrict
editting of this page to users?

## Wikipedia Requirements not FIRSTwiki Requirements

Months?!?!?!? this thing has only been up for 2 weeks tops! 500-1000 edits?
that's a little more resonable (though probably the only people who have meet
this requirement are already sysops) Can Max post specific numbers? Or should
I forget that? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303

    I didn't really mean those guidelines, i meant more of the formatting and the system of putting comments down. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 22:26, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Is there a page that lists users and # of edits? Sorted preferably? And, where can I find how many edits user _x_ has? --[SilverStar](User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 00:31, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)

##  By user quality or need of administrators?

Is the induction of sysops and bureaucrats only by votes (a large number of
positive votes would indicate a high quality user) or does it take into
account the need for administrators at the time?

    Definitley not solely by number of votes, but I'd hope that need for administrators shouldn't factor into it. As I said on [FIRSTwiki:community decisions](FIRSTwiki:Community_decisions "FIRSTwiki:Community decisions" ), I think anyone qualified should be granted adminship. Of course, our needs in an admin are not nearly as strict as Wikipedia's. Moderating disputes is probably a minor issue, while presence on FIRSTwiki is a much larger issue as we need administrators more for helping new people (and fixing their edits). --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 23:11, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT)

I know about the pipe, I had just copied the page directly from Wikipedia's,
but thanks. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 00:16, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
