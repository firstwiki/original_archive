### Todos

  * Fix the [Motors (FLL)](/index.php/Motors_%28FLL%29 "Motors \(FLL\)" ) vs. [Motor (FLL)](/index.php/Motor_%28FLL%29 "Motor \(FLL\)" ). There is good in both, but shouldn't be two pages. 
  * Create an "event" and "team page" template to be used on the category pages - should link to related pages to find teams or events, and to the "how to" pages on creating a team or event page that is missing.
