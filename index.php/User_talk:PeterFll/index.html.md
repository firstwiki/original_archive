### Todos

- Fix the [Motors (FLL)](Motors_%28FLL%29 "Motors \(FLL\)") vs. [Motor (FLL)](Motor_%28FLL%29 "Motor \(FLL\)"). There is good in both, but shouldn't be two pages.
- Create an "event" and "team page" template to be used on the category pages - should link to related pages to find teams or events, and to the "how to" pages on creating a team or event page that is missing.
