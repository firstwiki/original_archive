--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Robot Controller**, or **RC** is the unit of the [control system](Control_system "Control system") that processes [input](Input "Input"), is responsible for [communication](Radio_modem "Radio modem"), and controls the robot through various [outputs](Output "Output"). There are two types of Robot Controllers -- the Full-size version and the controller from the [Robovation](robovation) kit.

The Full-size Robot Controller receives data from the [Operator Interface](operator-interface), and controls the [spike relays](spike-relay), [motors](Motors "Motors"), and [servos](Servo "Servo"). It is the unit that is [programmed](Programming "Programming").

## History

The RC tends to change slightly from year to year, where most of the change is slight improvements.

There have been major changes, however. In 2000, the [BASIC Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp") was switched from [BS2](BS2 "BS2") to [BS2sx](BS2sx "BS2sx"). In 2003, an [autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode") feature was implemented. The most significant change, though, occurred in 2004, when the basic processor was changed from a [BASIC Stamp](/index.php?title=BASIC_Stamp&action=edit "BASIC Stamp") to a [PIC chip](PIC_chip "PIC chip"). In 2009, the RC was completely thrown out for the National Instruments [cRIO](CRIO "CRIO").

To learn more about the multiple varieties of the RC, see their specific pages.
