An **off-season competition** is like a miniature
[regional](/index.php/Regional "Regional" ) competition, except that it is run
by [teams](/index.php/Team "Team" ) or some other non-[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST
"FIRST" ) entity and may incorporate slight changes to the
[rules](/index.php?title=FRC_Rules&action=edit "FRC Rules" ).
