**Mascot**

  * Mascots are the the teams physical representation of their teams logo. Commonly a robot, animal, or a various creature/object. Although they don't fill an actual role in Robot Construction (although they can), they contribute to team spirit; much like a cherleader does. 


# Types

  * There are many types of team mascots, these include but are not limited too: 
  * Actual Robots 
  * Robots representatives of animals 
  * Animals 
  * Dancing Hats 
  * Robotics Chairs 
  * "pixies" 
  * People who take various clothing and objects and put them on themselves then dance 

For example for team 173 Rage Robotics the Mascot is a red Bulldog being as
enthusiastic as possible.
