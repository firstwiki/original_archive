# Dean Kamen

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Dean Kamen** is an American inventor and founder of [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). 

Probably most well-known to the public from the publicity surrounding the
product that eventually became known as the [Segway
HT](/index.php?title=Segway_HT&action=edit "Segway HT" ) \- a kind of electric
scooter with a complex, computer-controlled gyroscopic stabilisation and
control system that keep the Segway balanced on two side-by-side wheels and
controlled by moving body weight. The machine's secret development was the
object of much speculation after segments of a book quoting [Steve
Jobs](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs "wikipedia:Steve_Jobs" ) [![Ima
ge:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)](/index.php/Image:E
xtlinkwikipedia.GIF "Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ) and other notable IT
visionaries espousing its society-revolutionising potential were leaked in
1999.

In 1992, Mr. Kamen founded [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ). Mr. Kamen
remains the driving force behind the competition providing over 900 high
schools with the tools needed to learn valuable engineering skills.

Mr. Kamen was already a successful and wealthy inventor, after inventing a new
type of blood pumping and filtering system for medical applications, as well
as an all-terrain electric wheelchair using many of the same gyroscopic
balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.

In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the [Lemelson-MIT
Prize](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemelson-MIT_Prize "wikipedia:Lemelson-
MIT_Prize" ) [![Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)]
(/index.php/Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF "Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ) for
inventors for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for
[diabetics](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/diabetics "wikipedia:diabetics" ) [!
[Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)](/index.php/Ima
ge:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF "Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ).

Kamen owns the small [North Dumpling
Island](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dumpling_Island
"wikipedia:North_Dumpling_Island" ) [![Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb
/Extlinkwikipedia.GIF)](/index.php/Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF
"Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ) off the coast of
[Connecticut](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut
"wikipedia:Connecticut" ) [![Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF](/media/c/cb/Extlinkwi
kipedia.GIF)](/index.php/Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF
"Image:Extlinkwikipedia.GIF" ), and has "declared" the island to be an
independent state.
