## History

The NASA ARC Robotics Team, the Cheesy Poofs, competes in the FIRST robotics
competition as Team 254. FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and
Technology) is a national organization that focuses on inspiring students
about math and science. FIRST (www.usfirst.org), among other things, runs a
national robotics competition; this competition involves students, adults, and
engineers in the challenging and multifaceted robot design and construction
process.

The Cheesy Poofs Robotics Team, 254, has evolved over the past seven years
from the smallest program in the country in 1999, at a struggling high school,
to a large program based at the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). While the
team's student members have changed, the Cheesy Poofs have continued to
flourish.

From the modest beginning of Team 254 in the fall of 1998, NASA engineers Bob
Holmes and Steve Kyramarios joined teacher Jason Morrella in exciting students
about robotics and about teamwork. This spirit of team work continues today,
in spite of the downsizing of Broadway high school, to the subsequent transfer
of the program to Bellarmine College Preparatory in the fall of 2000, to what
it has evolved to here in 2009. With the support of mentors and teachers Cory
McBride, EJ Sabathia, Travis Covington, Kirk Oden, Jakub Fierdovicz, Rob
Janke, and Jim Urhausen, as well as additional volunteers, we are looking
forward to a great year.

In the past, 254 has started numerous teams on the West Coast and has
collaborated with teams 22, 60 and 968.
