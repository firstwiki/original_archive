## Criticisms

Kevin Watson is infamous among several teams in the FRC for his improvement to
the generate_pwms function in the default code. His new function has been seen
not to work in robots, often making dead zones go haywire and forcing pwms to
go at full blast when placed slightly past their dead zones.

  * Has a pet monkey 
  * Is the son of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man
