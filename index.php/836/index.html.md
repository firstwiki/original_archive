## History

Team 836 was formed in 2002 by Dave Buddenbohn of the James A. Forrest Career
and Technology Center. The team is composed of about 40 high school students,
and around 20 mentors. Together the team has designed and constructed 6 robots
and participated in 10 competitions, including 3 nationals.

In 2002 the team was awarded the outstanding rookie award at the VCU regional
in Richmond, VA. In 2003, because of its excellence in programming, the team
was awarded the leadership in control award at the Chesapeake Regional held at
the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. In 2005, the now expanded
team won the leadership in control award again due to a highly complex
autonomus mode option control system at the USNA.
