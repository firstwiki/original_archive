## History

### 2004-Present Atlanta, GA

The main event is held in the Georgia Dome, and the pits are located in the
adjacent Georgia World Congress Center. The team party has been held in
Centennial Olympic Park and inside the GWCC with fireworks, a hypnotist, and
inflatable games as entertainment, and of course, free food for all attending
team members.

### 2003 Houston, TX

[FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) outgrew Epcot Center, so the championship
had to move to Houston. While in one sense the Epcot Center was outgrown, the
primary reason for the move to Houston was bad timing -- Disney had something
planned for the date [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) wanted, and the
conflict could not be resolved in a timely fashion. The fields were in Reliant
Stadium and the pits were in the adjacent Astrodome. The team party was held
at Six Flags AstroWorld across the street.

Einstein field in 2002

After 1994, the Championship was moved to
[Epcot](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot "wikipedia:Epcot" ) in [Disney
World](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_World "wikipedia:Disney_World" ).
In 1995 and 1996, it was held in the American Pavilion (now the American
Adventure Theater). In 1997 and after, it was held in the parking lot of Epcot
in tents. There was one large tent for the pits and from 1997-1999, there were
seperate tents for each field. From 2000 to 2002, the pit tent was extended,
and all the smaller fields were moved into that tent, while Einstein (the
large field) remained outdoors. However, Epcot told [FIRST](FIRST
"FIRST" ) that it could not accommodate any more teams (their pit tent already
was large enough to hold 3 747's tail to nose), and so beginning in the 2002
season, a team had to [qualify](Qualify "Qualify" ) to go to
nationals. But despite all of that, Dean and Disney are still good friends,
with Disney sponsoring a few [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) teams, and
even showing off, and renting, Segways in the parks.
