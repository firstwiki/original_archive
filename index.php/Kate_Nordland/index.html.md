3 years as a [mentor](Mentor "Mentor") for [73](73 "73"), and the past 7 years as a mentor for [340](340 "340"), I never actually had a FIRST team at high school. I got involved through [RIT](Rochester_Institute_of_Technology "Rochester Institute of
Technology"), where I am an instructor in the Mechanical Engineering department and Faculty Adviser of the FIRST Robotics club. Morning classes will allow me to continue working with the [Finger Lakes Regional](Finger_Lakes_Regional "Finger Lakes Regional") Planning Committee to establish and maintain a high level of rookies in the Rochester, NY and surrounding areas.

I was flattered this year to be the Finger Lakes Recipient of the Regional Woodie Flowers Award.
