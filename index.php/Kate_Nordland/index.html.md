3 years as a [mentor](Mentor "Mentor" ) for [73](73 "73"
), and the past 7 years as a mentor for [340](340 "340" ), I never
actually had a FIRST team at high school. I got involved through
[RIT](Rochester_Institute_of_Technology "Rochester Institute of
Technology" ), where I am an instructor in the Mechanical Engineering
department and Faculty Adviser of the FIRST Robotics club. Morning classes
will allow me to continue working with the [Finger Lakes
Regional](Finger_Lakes_Regional "Finger Lakes Regional" ) Planning
Committee to establish and maintain a high level of rookies in the Rochester,
NY and surrounding areas.

I was flattered this year to be the Finger Lakes Recipient of the Regional
Woodie Flowers Award.
