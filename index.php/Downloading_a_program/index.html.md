### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

This article explains how to **download a program** from a computer to either
the [Full-size Robot Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot
Controller" ) or the [Robovation](Robovation "Robovation" ) kit.
Note that it is necessary to have a _hex_ file to download, but the actual
source code is not needed.

  1. Using [MPLAB](MPLAB "MPLAB" ), **build** the project to produce a _hex_ file (see [Using MPLAB](Using_MPLAB "Using MPLAB" ) for more information on how to do this) 
  2. **Connect** one end of a DB9 M-F cable to the serial port on the computer 
  3. **Connect** the other end of the cable to the program port on the [Robot Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" )
  4. Press and hold the program button on the RC until the first LED is green and some other LED is orange. 
  5. Open [IFI Loader](IFI_Loader "IFI Loader" ), click browse and locate the _hex_ file produced in step 1, then **download**
