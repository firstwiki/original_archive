Should there be a [fabrication](Fabrication "Fabrication" ) page in
the technical section? I realize it overlaps some with some of the other areas
(e.g., motors or pneumatics), but programming overlaps with control systems
and electronics. It seems like it could have quite a few articles in its own
right. I'm going to go ahead and add it, so put any objections here.
