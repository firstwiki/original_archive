Should there be a [fabrication](Fabrication "Fabrication") page in the technical section? I realize it overlaps some with some of the other areas (e.g., motors or pneumatics), but programming overlaps with control systems and electronics. It seems like it could have quite a few articles in its own right. I'm going to go ahead and add it, so put any objections here. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls")
