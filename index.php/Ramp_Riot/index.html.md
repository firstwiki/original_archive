**Ramp Riot** is an [off-season competition](Off-season_competition "Off-season competition"). As of 2007, the competition is in its eight year and remains one of the older off-season competitions. It is held in the main gym of the Wissahickon High School and is hosted by Team [341](341 "341").

The event began with seven local teams and as of 2007 had thirty-six teams attending the competition. Ramp Riot has also been traditionally the last competition of the year before the next season begins.
