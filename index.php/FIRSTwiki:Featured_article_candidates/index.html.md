_Discussion on this feature is happening on the [Community
decisions](FIRSTwiki:Community_decisions "FIRSTwiki:Community
decisions" ) page._

Below are the articles submitted to be _feature articles._ If you have any
**objection** to them, **record your view** here and offer improvements for
change. The articles are here so they receive your **attention** \-- fix them
up, give them that little edge they need to be consumed by the general masses.
Clear up FIRST-centric jargon that a new-comer might be unfamiliar with, add
'see also' links where appropriate, check grammar, etc.

To vote for an article, just move an article One Tier up (as in from Tier 1 to
Tier 2, etc.). To object to an article, move it one Tier down and provide
suggestions. The article with the highest tier will go up as the featured
article.

You may also want to see the [FIRSTwiki:Featured
articles](FIRSTwiki:Featured_articles "FIRSTwiki:Featured articles"
) page so you don't accidentally vote for an article that was already
featured.
