## History

**2004**

Spring: The seeds of a Bishop Brady High School robotics team are sown when
students Joshua Slocum and John Hayes inquire about participating in a
robotics team only to discover no such team yet exists at the school. Josh's
mother, Deb Slocum, steps forward to mentor a team and gauges interest by
involving the students in RoboCup Junior.

Fall: Based on the success of the RoboCup Junior experience, Mrs. Slocum and
the students form FIRST Robotics Team 1517. The team is known as Phi, Pi, Pho,
Phun (P4) which was a nod to the Bishop Brady School mascot name, the Green
Giants.

**2005**

Team 1517 has a wildly successful premiere, winning the Highest Seeded Rookie
Award and the Rookie All-Star Award at the BAE Systems Granite State Regional.
The team also qualifies for the National Championship and travels to Atlanta.

**2006**

The team once again competes in the BAE Granite State Regional. In the fall,
they participate in Savage Soccer winning the Most Robust Robot Award. Though
still known as "P4" the team adopts a new uniform, red plaid flannel shirts.
The shirts are inspired by the "woodsy" character of rural New Hampshire.

**2007**

Red plaid flannel is still the wardrobe of choice and the theme is extended to
include a lumberjack design. This year the Brady team expands their community
outreach by sponsoring and hosting a FIRST Lego League competition. The team
also mentors junior high school FLL teams in the Concord, NH area. Once again,
Team 1517 competes at the BAE Systems Granite State Regional. A second
regional is added to the team's schedule, Las Vegas! In Vegas, the Brady 'bot
impressed Apple Computer co-founder, Steve Wozniak, and subsequently captured
the Judges' Award. The team finished 3rd overall in Las Vegas.

**2008**

Live "Safety Man" and "Lumberjack" mascots accompany the Brady robot to the
arena. Marking their 4th appearance in a FIRST competition, the team has
another excellent season. At the BAE Granite State Regional, Team 1517 makes
it to the final match and is recognized with the Underwriters Laboratory
Safety Award. Choosing the New York City Regional as a second competition,
Brady advances to the quarter finals and is awarded the prestigious Motorola
Quality Award.
