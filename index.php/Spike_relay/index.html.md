## Data

The [Robot Controller](robot-controller) sends a Relay signal to the Spike. When it recieves a FWD signal, it applies +12v to M+ and grounds M-. Likewise when it recieves a REV signal, it applies +12v to M- and grounds M+. When both signals are recieved, +12v is applied to M+ and M- and nothing is grounded.

## Connections

### Motors

Spikes can be connected to a [motor](motor) that does not need to move at a variable speed. The motor cannot draw more than 20A.

### Solenoids

Spikes can be connected to one or two solenoids. To connect two solenoids simply ground the negative ends of the [solenoid](Solenoid "Solenoid") to the grounding portion of the [breaker panel](Breaker_panel "Breaker panel") and the positive ends to M+ and M-.

### Air Compressor

The air compressor can also be connected to the Spike, but care should be taken to always observe the proper polarity. The NEG output should never be enabled. If the compressor is powered in reverse, it will appear to function, but it will be drawing more current and producing more heat than it should for the amount of air it moves.

### Pinout of Control Input

The control input to the Spike relay is a three-pin receptacle where a three- wire cable from the [Robot controller](Robot_controller "Robot
controller") is connected to. The black wire is grounded.

When the white wire is at +5V and the red wire is at 0V, M+ receives the full input voltage. When the red wire is at +5V and the white wire is at 0V, M- receives the full input voltage.

# Spike Red

Occasionally you might see versions of the Spike relay floating around that have red lettering. These are older editions of the relay and lack reverse polarity protection on their inputs.
