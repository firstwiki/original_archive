## History

In 2003, a small group of deveoted students and teachers alike at Sinclair
Secondary School in Whitby, Ontario, Canada, came together to take part in the
FIRST Robotics Competition. Supported by both the school and community around
the Durham Region, the "Sinclair Sprockets" Robotics Team has been competing
in the FIRST Canadian Regionals at Missassauga for two successful seasons.
Known for their one-of-a-kind drive systems, flawless autonomous programs and
classy black and gold golf shirts, the Sprockets have grown in numbers from a
small after-school meeting of twelve to a full-year course of 25 plus held in
their school. As a returning competitor for their third season after taking a
break last year, Sinclair Sprockets hope to yet again amaze the crowd in the
2008 season by possibly winning another medal round award and moving on to the
nationals.
