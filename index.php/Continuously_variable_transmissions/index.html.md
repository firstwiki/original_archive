##  Synopsis

[This page](http://www.gizmology.net/cvt.htm
"http://www.gizmology.net/cvt.htm" ) does a good job of describing CVTs. The
basic principle is that of two pulleys that are variable in size. Instead of
shifting between gears as in a normal transmission, the sizes of these wheels
change, effecitively producing an infinite number of gear ratios. This type of
CVT is rarely seen, but it illustrates the point effectively.

###  Intermeshing Cones

The basic principle here is that two cones are fashioned such that they can
slide in and out of one another, effectively creating a v-shaped pulley that
varies in size as the cones are moved in and out of one another. This type of
CVT is often seen [in motorcycles](http://www.kawasaki.co.uk/atv/specification
.asp?RangeFlag=3&DealerRange=Atv&Model=ksv700-a "http://www.kawasaki.co.uk/atv
/specification.asp?RangeFlag=3&DealerRange=Atv&Model=ksv700-a" ).

###  Toroidal

This type is illustrated below. Essentially two toroids are mounted across
from one another, connected to shafts that serve as the input and output of
the transmission. A secondary frictional wheel rotates within the two toroids
transferring torque in different ratios depending on its position.

###  Super Simple

A wheel connected to the motor spins, and a smaller wheel mounted
perpendicular to it slides along it's surface. Imagine a record player with a
wheel instead of a read head, and imagine how the speed of rotation would
change as the wheel got closer to the center of the record. This isn't very
practicle either. See [this ChiefDelphi
thread](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=24376

information and images.

##  Application in FIRST

As with any [drive train](/index.php/Drive_train "Drive train" ), drive trains
in FIRST try to maximize the power output of the system. Though CVTs are very
inefficient compared to more traditional gearing systems, they can be used to
actually increase the effectiveness of the drive train because they can
provide peak power over a at all RPMs and consequently at all times. On the
other hand, a traditional system may provide even higher efficiency/ouput at
one point (or several points in a system with multiple
[gears](/index.php?title=Gears&action=edit "Gears" )), it will be less
effective at other RPMs.

Two teams, [64](/index.php/64 "64" ) and [190](/index.php/190 "190" ), have
used a CVT in a FIRST robot, with mixed results (see [this CD
thread](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19490&highlight=cvt
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19490&highlight=cvt" ) for
more info). Several teams claim to have used CVTs, but have in fact used used
a so-called ["Planetary
CVT"](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25113#223425
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=25113#223425" ). A
planetary "CVT", such as the [ThunderChickens'
CCT](http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=79
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/papers.php?s=&action=single&paperid=79" ),
is not actually a CVT, and [functions quite differently](http://www.chiefdelph
i.com/forums/showpost.php?p=223425&postcount=21
"http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=223425&postcount=21" ) from
a one.
