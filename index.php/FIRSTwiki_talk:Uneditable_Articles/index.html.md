##  Index of Regionals and Team Info

[Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ), if there was some
change you were trying to make to the [Index of
Regionals](Index_of_Regionals "Index of Regionals" ) and [Team
Info](Team_Info "Team Info" ) pages, I am able to make them for you
if you tell me what they are. The wiki does let me edit those pages.

P.S. is there some way to get it to automatically fill out the "reported by"
bit on the page or do you just fill that in yourself?

  * Thanks for the offer. If I get to it, I'll make a list of the edits I was trying to make. My schedule is a bit hectic right now, so I probably won't get to it for a while. I just filled out the "reported by" parts on this article manually. [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 20:18, 12 November 2007 (EST) 
  * This is pissing me off. I posted some stuff to [[1]](http://nate.laverdure.googlepages.com/edits.txt "http://nate.laverdure.googlepages.com/edits.txt" ). [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 01:37, 2 December 2007 (EST)

## Hack

I have this problem, and I have found that it's a limit on the characters. I
tried adding a bit of my team's page one at a time, and it wouldn't let me
save the last little bit. That means there is a limit of characters you can
use. What I did was split my team's page in half, put the two halves on
different pages on my userpage (User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st half and
User:MindstormsKid/Team page 2nd half). I then put the following on my team's
page:

    
    
     {{FLLteamtable|
     |name=Team Terastorm
     |color=blue
     |image=[[Image:TeamTerastorm.jpg|314px|Team logo]]
     |yearfounded=2007
     |organization=Chattanooga Engineers Club
     |city=Chattanooga
     |stateorcountry=Tennessee
     |website=[http://teamterastorm.googlepages.com/ Team website]
     }}
     {{User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st half}}
     {{User:MindstormsKid/Team page 2nd half}}
     
    

It worked. Note: **Be sure to put the FLLteamtable template ON THE ARTICLE
PAGE, _not_ a different page.** [MindstormsKid](User:MindstormsKid

  * It seems very odd that it would do this, particularly because it seems to be limited to some pages (as there are many pages with a lot of content which can still be edited). Perhaps that is just part of this glitch, like the wiki software sets some weird text limit to certain pages for no particular reason. Very odd. Hopefully we can get someone to update the software soon to fix all these problems. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 09:45, 19 March 2008 (EDT) 
  * It's not a character limit. [Doshindude](/index.php?title=User:Doshindude&action=edit "User:Doshindude" ) 07:47, 24 March 2008 (EDT) 


## Can't tag

The glitch prevents tagging glitched articles. Paradox much?
