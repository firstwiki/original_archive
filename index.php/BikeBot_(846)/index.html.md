## History

Lynbrook Robotics is an award-winning robotics team that is currently in its
sixth season. Founded in 2001 at Lynbrook High School, LRT has won several
honors such as the Woodie Flowers award, the KG&amp;B Entrepreneurial award
and the Gracious Professionalism award in addition to advancing to semi-finals
several times while participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition . Last
year at the Silicon Valley Regionals, we seeded 4th during preliminary matches
and 1st during preliminary matches at the Lone Star Regional. In the 2005-2006
season, LRT had the honor of competing at the FIRST Nationals in
Atlanta,Georgia.

While not competing, we fundraise at events such as Concours d'Elegance and
Fleet Week in addition to doing community presentations at places like the San
Jose Tech Museum and our sponsors' companies. During the summer of 2007, we
mentored a group of students at Calder Academy as well as at Oak Grove High
School in San Jose, CA. We are currently mentoring 2 FLL teams composed of
students from our local middle school, Miller M.S., and a collaboration of
students from several local elementary schools.
