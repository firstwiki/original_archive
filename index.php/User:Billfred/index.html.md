## The Man With a Plan

  * Legal name: William Jullian Leverette, Jr. 
  * Nickname: Billfred 
  * Date of birth: May 20, 1986 
  * Occupation: Unemployed. Ask me about employment opportunities. 
  * Residence: Columbia, SC 
  * Education: Extended Studies Diploma, Irmo High School (note that this was awarded alongside his standard high school diploma, making for a rather annoying dilemma since his diploma cover has room for only one.) 
  * To date, is the only person on 1293 to be tackled by a robot in autonomous operation. 


## The Team

2004-2006: Team [1293](/index.php/1293 "1293" ), Irmo High School &amp; Dutch
Fork High School &amp; Chapin High School, aka D5 Robotics.

2007-present: Team [1618](/index.php?title=1618&action=edit "1618" ), Columbia
High School, aka Capital Robotics.


## The Volunteer

  * 2004: FIRST Championship, Real-time scoring for Archimedes Field. (And in one practice match, robot. No teams brought a robot to that match, so all of the volunteers were feeding them balls. I wheeled over a mobile goal, and got a ball in the head for it.) 
  * 2004: Robot Rodeo, scoring/field assembly/field disassembly 
  * 2005: Manchester Kickoff, field disassembly 
  * 2005: FIRST Championship, real-time scorekeeping 
  * 2005: The Capital Clash, DJ/play-by-play/mentor round emcee. (The mentor round was played for laughs--it may well be the first time an emcee has said "Here goes nothing" before a match.) 
  * 2006: FVC Orangeburg Pilot, Judge 
  * 2006: Florida Regional, Inspector/Field Reset 
  * 2006: Palmetto Regional, Team Social assistant 
  * 2006: FIRST Championship, FVC Referee/FRC Field Reset 
  * 2006: Mission Mayhem, Referee/Game Redesign 
  * 2006: Exploding Bacon Vex Event, Head Referee 
  * 2006: Duel on the Delaware, Ball Counter 
  * 2006: Cal Games, Game Announcer 
  * 2007: Florida Regional, Inspector 


## The Future

Plans over the next four to five years:

  * Attend the University of South Carolina 
  * Earn a degree from the Moore School of Business in Marketing 
  * Enjoy himself thoroughly 
  * Continue involvement in FIRST, which oughta be easy because the [Palmetto Regional](/index.php/Palmetto_Regional "Palmetto Regional" ) is about four blocks from his dorm room. 
  * Get more FIRST shirts. Sixteen is not enough. 


## The Name

It's a long story.
