It looks you've been frequenting FIRSTwiki. If you have engineering expertise to share, dive into [how-tos](How-to "How-to"); we don't seem to have a lot of mechanical stuff. Also, be sure to [make suggestions](User:Hallry/Suggestions "User:Hallry/Suggestions") about how the wiki can be improved. Thanks! [Member](User:Member "User:Member") 19:28, 7 June 2011 (EDT)
