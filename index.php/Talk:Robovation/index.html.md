**I have stricken EDU bot from all FIRSTwiki pages. All EDU bot references are now Robovation. ** \--[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 21:08, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Why?!?!?!?!?!?!? Why, oh why????? Why did it have to be moved?

I know, I know. I liked Edu Bot myself. But trademarks are serious issues --
if a company doesn't actively defend it, it will lose it ... meaning it's
lawyers will be out on the hunt. Plus, since this is an encyclopedia about
FIRST, and FIRST will be calling it "Robovation", that's what people will
search for here to learn more about it. You'll note Edu Bot refers to
Robovation, and the page explains the trademark issue. Times are a changin' :D

I believe I already had such a discusion with Max about this. Everyone calls
them "Band-aids", not "Sheer Bandages", "Flexible Fabric Bandages", or
"Adhesive Bandages". In the same way, some one will look for probably look for
EDU Bot. And I will likely continue to refer to the unit as the EDU Bot.

    The issue here is the term has become common usage. It is similar with 'Xeorox.' This is a specific legal concept ... and if the company who owns the trademark doesn't actively defend it (e.g., to prevent it from being common usage), then it loses its right to it. I just don't see the point in us calling it Edu Bot in an official sense here, if FIRST isn't doing it. Doing it with our team is algright, but it would be best to just mention the issue and follow FIRST lingo IMO. See [wikipedia:Trademark](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "wikipedia:Trademark" ) for the legal stuff. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 21:43, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I'm still unsure on this one, I'm gonna have to stay neutral. I'd like to
point out that the [innovationFIRST
website](http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-kits.htm
"http://innovationfirst.com/FIRSTRobotics/edu-kits.htm" ) still uses EDU
(though not EDU bot) and that the EDU bot controller is now called the "mini
robot controller" --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 18:13, 2 Jun 2004

    Good lord! no one knows what to call it anymore! (Who decided one "Robovation"?) --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 18:16, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    There was an announcement from FIRST saying Robovation is the official name, or at least a CD thread said there was such an announcement. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 18:27, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    In addition, the FIRST website includes the same "disclamer" about trademarks that appears on this site. If FIRST says so, it must be so. So, as they say, lets discontinue **all** use of the phrase EDU bot and replace it with Robovation. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 20:52, 2 Jun 2004 (EDT)
