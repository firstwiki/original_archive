## History

Cougar Robotics Team 1403 is a FIRST Robotics Competition team from Montgomery
High School, in Skillman, New Jersey. The Robotics team was first started at
Montgomery High School in 2004, since then, it has expanded to the point where
we have become a New Jersey host of the Kickoff Event, as well as the host of
the off-season event: Monty Madness. Team 1403 Cougar Robotics has grown in
membership since that time, with over fifty students on the team. In addition,
we are now sponsored by over four different groups, including Bristol-Myers
Squibb (BMS), and Convatec.
