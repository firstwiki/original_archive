##  Autonomous mode disable?

I was just wondering, a recent edit seems to conflict with the article a bit,
and so I was wondering if anyone knew what was correct.

The article currently says "If done in 10 seconds, that team will enter into
autonomous mode when all teams are on the mats. If done in 15 seconds, the
**teams won't enter autonomous mode, but will work afterwards**. If the human
player doesn’t return in 15 seconds, the **robot is disabled for the
autonomous portion** of the match." Previously it said: "**the robot is
disabled for the match**."

The current version appears to be redundant and therefor conflicting. I was
not around during this game so I don't know, but if anyone does, could they
please make any necessary edits (if any edits are necessary). Thanks!

  * Good catch I don't know what I was thinking. I remembered some team using the mat to disable their autonomous mode but, I forgot the timing. Oh well apparently I can't read.--[Fizzix](User:Fizzix "User:Fizzix" ) 18:35, 24 April 2008 (EDT) 
  * Alright, just checking. Thanks. ;) [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 18:59, 24 April 2008 (EDT)
