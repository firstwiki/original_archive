## History

FLL at Trident Technical College started in 2002. Our team is made up entirely
of homeschoolers from 9-14 from the tri county SC area. The main goals of the
team are to instill a sense of teamwork and gracious professionalism in its
members and to impart valuable engineering, science and mathematics skills
through LEGO robotics. We have been honored to twice win the South Carolina
State Director's Award and represent our state at the FLL Championships. The
team is entering its 5th season in 2006-2007 and looks forward to many more
productive years.

## Events Attended


## 2005-2006


### Trident Tech Scrimmage

**Date Attended: December 10, 2005**

For the second year in a row, Trident Tech and its FLL team, The Beach
Busters, were able to host a scrimmage for Lowcountry teams. The theme of this
year's event was "Catch the Tech Wave". In a non-competitive, fun event, teams
were encouraged to mentor each another and share knowledge about robot design
and programming. Each team completed several runs and a technical
presentation. A Junior FLL event was also held with teams from local area
elementary schools, community groups and homeschooled teams.


### South Carolina State Tournament

**Date Attended: January 14, 2006 (Day 2 of 2)**

The Beach Busters (Team 164) had a great time at this year's South Carolina
State Tournament. For the first time, the state tournament was held over two
days and the team attended on the second day of competition. The Beach Busters
won the State Director's Award for that day's tournament and received high
marks from the judges. Congratulations also to the F.I.R.S.T Knights of St.
John's Catholic School in North Charleston on being the Director's Award
runners up.


### 2006 FLL World Festival

**Date Attended: April 27-29, 2006**

The Beach Busters were one of two teams representing South Carolina at this
year's FLL World Festival. The team learned a lot and had several succesful
table runs and presentations. We met a lot of people from across the globe and
became good friends with the South African FLL team, the Explorobots, whom we
were partnered with for the alliance exercise.


## 2006-2007


### Trident Tech Scrimmage

**Date Attended: January 13, 2007**

For the first time, Trident Tech and its FLL team, The Nano Ninjas hosted a
regional tournament. We had a great time with twenty one other teams and
competed in the areas of performance, teamwork, robot design and research
presentation quality. Team 530 was fortunate enough to win first place in the
research presentation category. Special congratulations to The Atom Busters,
Champion's Award winners.


### South Carolina State Tournament

**Date Attended: January 27, 2007 (Day 2 of 2)**

The Nano Ninjas quite possibly had our best tournament this year at Saturday's
State FLL Tournament. The team had lots of positive energy and teamwork as we
competed in all areas and farewelled some of our team members and young adult
mentor, for whom this would be their last year with FLl @ Trident Tech. Team
530 finished sixth in robot performance out of 58 teams. The Nano Ninjas were
very proud to win second place in the Champion's Award and see Mr. Sam win not
only the Outstanding Volunteer Award but also the Adult Mentor Award. All in
all, a very succesful season!

Good luck to Doby's Mill Elementary (Friday's Champion's Award winners) and
Oakview Elementary (Saturday's Champion's Award) in Atlanta!

## Special projects

The Trident Tech FLL team has been very active in the community. Team members
always help with Trident's LEGO robotics summer camps and often accompany
mentors to help other teams during the FLL season. In January, mentors and
team members help set up and run Trident Tech's regional event. In 2005, as a
part of their research project for the "No Limits" challenge, the team built
an assembly line to help mentally disabled workers pack first aid kits and
other items. In 2006, the team is monitoring water quality near a oyster bed
in a local creek. During the season, the team always has guest speakers and
takes field trips relating to that year's challenge topic.


## Members List


### Students, Coaches and Mentors (oh my!)

For more information about our team please visit
<http://ttclegoleague.tridenttech.edu> Special thanks to our two mentors for
starting the team and sharing all their knowledge and time. Thanks also to the
Trident Tech faculty for their support.


### Mr. Sam

Mr. Sam, our mentor has been a wonderful asset to our team and to the
Lowcountry FLL community. Without his time and guidance, we would not the
equipment and space for a team. During each FLL season, he constantly inspires
our team with gracious professionalism and engineering mentorship. Mr. Sam
makes many visits each year to struggling or rookie teams to help them achieve
the FLL goals of learning about science and technology through robotics. He
also runs the Trident Tech regional robotics tournament every January.

In 2007, Mr. Sam was recognized at the state level with an Outstanding
Volunteer Award and the Adult Mentor Award, two very deserved accolades. Way
to go Mr. Sam!


## Sponsors

Our team works out of Trident Technical College and was sponsored in 2006 by
Trident Tech and Wal Mart. Past sponsors include Publix and Universal Software
Solutions.
