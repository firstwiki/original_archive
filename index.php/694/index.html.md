## History

We are a F.I.R.S.T. Robotics Team comprised of approximately 40 Stuyvesant
High School students. Our team works year-round, recruiting and training new
members, mentoring F.I.R.S.T. Lego League Teams IS 89 and MS 51, teaching
senior citizens how to use their personal computers, presenting our robots at
different city-wide events, and fundraising within the Stuyvesant alumni and
corporate communities.
