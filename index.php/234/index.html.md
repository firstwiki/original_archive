## History

Cyber Blue has been active as a FIRST Robotics team since 1999. Ever since
then, it has grown to be a nationally recognized team.

[[edit](/index.php?title=234&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Team
projects" )]

## Team projects

Cyber Blue Team 234 created the “FIRST International Partners” program in
2003,and the program has been growing since. In 2005, 14 teams were partnered
for the FIRST season.

Cyber Blue coordinates partnering US based teams with International teams that
might need help obtaining special materials (like game balls, plastic tubs,
spare parts, etc) and any other special needs (like travel planning, etc.).

The goal is to facilitate a bond between two teams that may be separated by
thousands of miles. Ideally, the teams would remain partnered for several
years, not just a season, and attend regionals together. Some teams have
arranged school tours, special dinners, sporting events and T-shirt exchanges.

Cyber Blue also mentors 3 Lego League Teams at the elementary level, 1 Lego
League Team at the 6th grade level, and 1 VEX team at Perry Meridian Middle
School.

Team 234 collects broken wheel chairs and medical equipment and use their
resources to repair and refurbish these items. The items are then donated to
the Timmy Foundation where they are sent to third world countries.

The team has a close relationship with their corporate sponsors with such
activities as Critical Design Reviews and Engineering support.

Cyber Blue co-hosts the Indiana Robotics Invitational with two other Indiana
teams. This is an off-season event where teams from all around the country
come to compete one last time with their robots. The draw to our event rivals
that of many FIRST regionals and has brought many of the top minds of FIRST to
Indianapolis.
