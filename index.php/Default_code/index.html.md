# Default code

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The **default code** provides pre-programmed functionality to the [Robot
Controller](Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ). This can allow
teams to spend more time on [fabricating](Fabrication "Fabrication"
) their [robot](Robot "Robot" ), so long as they don't need more
complicated control. But the default code also provides the starting point for
[programming](Programming "Programming" ) the FRC, and it is
necessary to understand the code before you decide to change it.

Each year the default code is different, so see the particular year that
