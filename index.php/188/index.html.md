## Slogan

The Force from the North!

[[edit](/index.php?title=188&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Identity" )]

## Identity

We have made a name for ourselves in FIRST as not only the oldest active non-
American team, but also a leader in reliable robot design. Our trademark is a
powerful drive system, and beginning in the '02 Season we phased in the use of
six drive motors. Our '04 Season gave birth to one of the most fastest _and_
most powerful robot in FIRST history. Our award-winning website underlines the
fact that we are trying hard to spread the word of FIRST, and, at the
inaugural Canadian Regional we created in 2002, we were awarded the Regional
Chairman's Award. Our hockey jersey red and white is a trademark and we are
well-known throughout the FIRST community.

## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

It's been well over a decade since a homely and unassuming high school called
Woburn, nestled in Toronto, first made their famous robotics team. It was the
year 1994 when a small company of curious students and teachers united under
the common goal of understanding the mechanics and challenge of building
robots. Certainly a completely new experience for this intrepid band of
youthful pioneers, it was also a challenge they were more than willing to
accept. As they quickly found, there was an abundance of creative energies
present, but an inability to harness this force. The newly formed robotics
club attempted to design and manufacture a robotic hand on their own, in
addition to some smaller projects, but it was the opportunity to compete in a
national robotics competition where the group really came together.

The competition, known as Canada FIRST, was the starting point from which
unexpected heights were to be reached; here was the birth of a team that would
not only win two national championships, but also proceed to represent Canada
in the biggest high school robotics competition on the planet, US FIRST.
Woburn Robotics (then known by the name, "Team Canada Robotics") is the first
of currently-active non-American teams to compete in the US FIRST robotics
competition, which paved the way for other international teams to participate
in what is now known simply as FIRST. Since it's inception, 188 has been
instrumental in the formation of over 20 teams and the Canadian Regional
venue, in addition to receiving some of the highest regional awards given out
by FIRST. There is now representation from several countries at the FIRST
robotics competition where approximately one thousand teams compete for
international recognition.

When the team initially entered Canada FIRST, both students and teachers had
no idea of what to expect. Little was known about the strength of the other
competitors or the difficulty of the national competition itself. Even with
this uncertainty, the thought of competing at a high level and the possibility
of winning the national championship was incentive enough to persist. It still
is, but only now, the stakes are higher.

We await another tough challenge and are excited to tackle it... by Force.
