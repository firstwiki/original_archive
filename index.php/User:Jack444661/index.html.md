NASA exploring ways to clean up space debris - Xinhua  Engli" )]

##  NASA exploring ways to clean up space debris - Xinhua Engli

by Mark Weisenmiller  
  
TAMPA, United States, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Facing the increasing threats of
area debris, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
that actively exploring ways apt clean up the external area.  
  
Donald Kessler, an astrophysicist at NASA's Environmental Effects Office, said
the district industry has been slowly developing ideas as over 30 annuals
aboard how to continue to clean up place junk,only none has ever been
completely tested.  
  
Space debris comes from asteroids, comets, meteorites and also defunct man-
made space devices alternatively their portions"Dead" satellites are an
instance of zone debris, which poses increasing risks to functional satellites
and the International Space Station.  
  
Kessler, the 1st capital of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office,[cheap
louboutin](http://www.christianlouboutshoes2012.com/
"http://www.christianlouboutshoes2012.com/" ), said there are three
fundamental issues apt be determined amid relation to the cleaning up of place
junk.  
  
"One, how do we acquire to the objects inexpensively? Two,[air jordan
13](http://www.michaeljordanoutlets.com/
"http://www.michaeljordanoutlets.com/" ), how do we catch an thing that namely
likely spinning and not designed to be grabbed? Three, what do we do with the
entity backward grabbing it?" Kessler told Xinhua.  
  
Another truth to consider that that astrophysicists and scientists have been
slow apt residence the heading To citation merely one case, NASA does not
annually spend any administration asset with regard apt the research and the
cleaning up of district junk.  
  
Size of space debris can be as small as an centimeter. Astrophysicists and
scientists have difficulty putting precise definitions apt tremendous"district
debris. However, usually an thing of 10 centimeters alternatively greater is
considered colossal"  
  
International interest surrounded cleaning up zone debris has appended
surrounded recent years especially since February 2009,meantime two disloyal
satellites collided at approximately 490 miles virtually 790 km) over Siberia,
creating over one,000 chips of area debris.  
  
Kessler, the creator of what is known as the "Kessler Syndrome," believes that
an increasing frequency of collision of zone junk want create "a permanent
strap of area debris" that would be so thick that it would be a danger apt any
attempted launched rocket or satellite.  
  
Two fashionable feasible ideas as cleaning up area debris are the use of
robust lasers,[timberland snow
boots](http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/
"http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/" ), whose projected laser beams
would move the zone junk into lower orbits to be burnt up, and the creation of
a matrix of nets to arrest some of the district junk.  
  
Kessler,although thinks that nor concept would be a utter solution,even now
they worked as planned.  
  
Numerous companies among North America are working on assorted zone junk
clean-up projects. One such company is the Star Technology and Research (STAR)
surrounded Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.  
  
STAR is the recent receiver of approximately two million U.S.greenbacks from
NASA apt create a spacecraft called ElctroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE).  
  
If successfully made and operated, EDDE would target non-functioning orbiting
satellites that meter an ton apiece.  
  
"EDDE ambition 'sail' aboard the Earth's charming field favor a sailing canoe
within the wind, giving it unlimited range, using solar power. This is the
breakthrough technology that makes feasible the removal of plenary colossal
dangerous debris objects among inexpensive Earth orbit. We are working to
develop the components that tell EDDE feasible STAR spokesman Jerome Pearson
told Xinhua.  
  
According apt the blueprint EDDE would guide to an extinct satellite, using a
solar-powered six-mile long district tether line. It will next expel a
tremendous net apt catch the targeted satellite, and lower itself into a lower
orbit. It ambition blaze out the caught satellite into the Earth's atmosphere
where it would subsequently flame up. Once EDDE ejects the
satellite,[christian lacroix](http://www.louboutinpumpsefrance.com/
"http://www.louboutinpumpsefrance.com/" ), it will"navigate back up into
higher orbit and proceed apt capture repeatedly non-operating satellite,
Pearson explained.  
  
There are more than 2,000 tons of debris in inexpensive Earth orbit,beneath
the two,000-kilometer height EDDE could arrest and destruction of the larger
dead"district satellites, Pearson said.  
  
But the main new threat apt operational satellites and to the astronauts
aboard the International Space Station namely the untracked shrapnel between
an and ten centimeters surrounded size, he said.  
  
"They are likewise small to alley with new means,merely they are enormous
enough apt damage a satellite or pierce an ISS module."  
  
Pearson said the entire international satellite launch community ought
logically share within the burden of cleaning up area debris.  
  
NASA's new policies on district debris were called into question by a report
released last September by the National Research Council,[karen
millen](http://www.karenmillenaustraliatop.com/
"http://www.karenmillenaustraliatop.com/" ), an affiliate of the Academy of
Sciences.  
  
"NASA ought collaborate with advertisement national, and international
agencies to redouble more clear information about the costs of debris
avoidance, mitigation, surveillance, and response. With this information, NASA
could develop a more detailed plan as long-term issues," said the report.

never as appealing as here in Shenzhen," Wu said.  
  
"Besides, we can better penetrate afterward him and give him the adore that he
doesn't obtain back kin Wu added.

他们希望把自己在商界的成功经验运用到这支NBA劲旅的经营中。狄维士家族对经营职业体育非常感兴趣，他们认识到职业体育对青年人的影响，所以努力使这支球队为青年人
树立积极、正面的形象，形成激励和鼓舞的力量。 &lt;P&gt;据悉，安利公司作为体育营销领域的翘楚，与NBA一直保持着紧密合作关系，安利旗下纽崔莱品牌，曾
经是NBA的全球合作伙伴。当年在魔术队打出名堂的NBA超级中锋大鲨鱼奥尼尔，即曾是安利纽崔莱的品牌代言人。2005年8月,[boutiques

News Analysis S&Ps downgrade to have limited impact on globa" )]

##  News Analysis S&amp;Ps downgrade to have limited impact on globa

according Yoo Seungki  
  
SEOUL, Aug.seven (Xinhua) -- The Global credit rating appraiser Standard &amp;
Poor's downgraded the U.S. government's prestige rating apt AA-plus from AAA
as the 1st time in its history,merely the clash aboard universal financial
markets are expected apt be limited market watchers said Sunday.  
  
The S&amp;P stripped the world's largest economy of its AAA long- term king
glory rating and lowered it forward one notch apt AA- plus aboard Friday
backward the U.S.mall approach This namely the 1st period the U.S. rating that
mowed beneath the highest class since 1941 when the S&amp;P began assigning
the U.S.honor rating. "The U.S. lost its AAA rating for the 1st
duration,[karen millen snow leopard
coat](http://www.karenmillenaustraliatop.com/
"http://www.karenmillenaustraliatop.com/" ),but there namely micro probability
as the rating apt fall below the AA grade over the afterward 10 years," Park
hee-chan, a Seoul-based economist at Mirae Asset Securities, said.  
  
Park anticipate the universal financial markets ambition likely show strong
volatility in the short-term,only the mall turbulences ambition be short-lived
because administration bonds with AA medal rating will continue apt petition
naught percentage of risk-weight prefer the AAA-rated bonds. "S&amp;P's
decision can hardly be characterized for a surprise because the U.S. public
finances are in a aggravate state than highest other OECD economies," Russell
Jones,global head of fixed-income strategy at Westpac Banking Corp., said in a
report released Sunday.  
  
WHY S&amp;P CUTS RATING S&amp;P lowered the U.S.an notch apt AA-plus meantime
keeping the attitude by negative as it becomes fewer confident that the
agreement on fiscal shortage relaxation namely adapted as putting the U.S.
finances on a sustainable footing. "The downgrade reflects our opinion that
the financial consolidation plan that Congress plus the Administration
recently agreed to falls short of what, in our outlook would be necessary apt
stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics," S&amp;P said in an-
emailed click release. While reaching a handle apt raise the debt ceiling
forward 2.an trillion dollars,[paul smith on
line](http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/ "http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/" ),
the U.S. Congress and Administration agreed to cut the allied spending by for
much for two.four trillion dollars over the afterward 10 years, which was
smaller than four trillion dollars needful onward the S&amp;P.  
  
The absence cut agreement thrust uncertainties for the reduction in government
expenditure will be implemented in two treads.  
  
The 917 billion dollars aspiration be slit in administration spending over the
after ten-year initially,[cheap timberland
boot](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" ), followed according one
additional 1.5 trillion won that the newly formed Congressional Joint Select
Committee on Deficit Reduction is supposed to recommend along November 23. If
the committee comprised of six Republican lawmakers and six Democrats,namely
incapable to accede aboard a plan cuts of 1.two trillion won want be
implemented automatically starting in January 2013.  
  
S&amp;P noted the measures are a tread before toward fiscal consolidation,only
warned that it leaves open the details of what namely finally agreed to until
the kill of this year.  
  
Political instability was cited as the hub of the U.S.medal rating downgrade.
"The downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness,stability plus
predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have
disabled as long as of ongoing monetary and economic challenges apt a degree
extra than we envisioned while we assigned a negative outlook to the rating
aboard April 18," S&amp;P said.  
  
LOW RISK FOR ADDITIONAL DOWNGRADE  
  
The S&amp;P kept its viewpoint on the U.S.prestige rating by
negative,beginning apartment as the rating apt be mowed among two years,merely
market watchers said there is mini feasibility as the rating apt be lowered in
the future as the U.S. net administration debt class namely higher than Japan
with a AA-minus medal rating.  
  
According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. net common ministry
debt aspiration stand at 72 percentage opposition the gross servant production
(GDP) in 2011. The S&amp;P expected the ratio to come in at 74 percentage this
year.  
  
The net prevalent government debt refers to forever levels of government debts
combined, excluding fluid financial assets.  
  
The expectations for the U.S. net debt ratio were much lower than the Japan's
expected 127 percentage for this annual The S&amp;P said the U.S. net debt
ratio could ascend apt 101 percent forward 2021 whether it assumes the worse-
case scenario, still lower than the expectation for the Japan's ratio.  
  
"There that cheap feasibility for the U.S.apt lose its AA rating over the then
10 years because Japan namely keeping its AA rating antagonism its lofty ratio
of net ministry debt," Park at Mirae Asset Securities said.  
  
Park expect the impact of the U.S. rating mowed ambition be quite finite
aboard financial companies as the AA rating aspiration secure naught
percentage of hazard heaviness that equals apt the AAA-rated bonds. "AA rated
kings have a quite strong capability to service debt aboard a timely basis,and
their characteristics are similar to those of AAA rated kings differing only
in degree," Jones at Westpac Banking said, quoting S&amp;P itself.  
  
The Fed has yet announced that U.S. Treasuries remain lofty grade and will
remain naught hazard weighted beneath Basel the second, Jones joined.  
  
Meanwhile, there namely micro feasibility for Moody's and Fitch apt follow the
suit with the S&amp;P because the other two appraisers have yet affirmed their
AAA honor rating on the U.S.by August two while U.S. President Barack Obama
signed the compromised bill that determined the debt-ceiling impasse. "Moody's
plus Fitch are unlikely to lower their U.S.honor rating in the foreseeable
future as they pronounced the highest rating behind the agreement on the debt
ceiling," Park at Mirae Asset Securities said.  
  
LIMINTED IMPACT Despite the rating downgrade, the impact aboard the global
financial markets are projected to be finite as there is no alternative apt
replace the U.S.administration bonds for safe assets,and the dollar will
maintain its position as the keep currency as the time being experts said.
"The overall clash aboard the global financial markets will be finite
deserving to absence of alternative to replace the U.S. Treasuries plus the
dollar's maintenance as the keep currency,[timberland
6](http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/
"http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/" )," the Korea Center as
International Finance (KCIF) said in a report.  
  
Credit Suisse said the U.S.administration bond yields are expected apt remain
by a cheap level for there is not alternative to replace the U.S. debts,plus
Wells Fargo expect that foreign landlords aspiration never sell aggressively
the U.S. bonds, citing the breadth of the Treasury mall plus the liquidity.
"It is complicated apt deem that potentate plus additional large scale holders
of the U.S. Treasuries want dump their holdings aggressively for the
subsequent dislocations apt the U.S.and prevalent economies would do them
considerable mar Jones at Westpact Banking said. The South Korean government
likewise said the rating cut's direct impact aboard the U.S.government bonds
ambition not be nipping According to the statement onward the Ministry of
Strategy and Finance, the S&amp;P mowed its rating aboard Japan by an level to
AA-minus in January,merely the Japanese yen and administration bonds were mini
affected forward the action. Likewise, the rating tore want never trigger a
clash on the U. S.administration bonds. South Korea said there is not
correction in the government's confidence in the U.S. Treasuries, noting that
momentous investors of the U.S.authority debts such for France, Russia and
Japan repeated their confidence on the Treasuries.  
  
LINGERING CONCERNS  
  
Despite the positive views, there remains the negative attitude for the
U.S.authority bonds because the rating tore longing inevitably raise the
lending costs as the U.S.administration.  
  
The U.S.can loan currency by a lower cost for the USD has kept its position as
the reserve currency,only the rating downgrade may pedal up the bond yield
along approximately 25 basis points,[timberland boots
sale](http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/
"http://www.timberland6inchsaleonlines.com/" ), according apt Barclays.  
  
JP Morgan predicted the rating slit could guide the U.S. Treasury yields apt
bound by more than 60 basis points,elevating heaving its lending costs
according 100 billion dollars annually.  
  
The diversification of the emigrant keeps could be quickened among emerging
nations. The KCIF anticipate that the proportion of dollar-denominated assets
apt the alien keeps will be reduced as discerned in the case of Japan's rating
downgrade.  
  
Knock-on downgrades could occur for the U.S. public corporations such as
Freddie Mac plus Fannie Mae, the KCIF said,adding that the possible downgrade
will combine surplus pressures aboard the government-related agencies funding
their operations. Related articles：

LV等洋品牌耍大牌 说是国际惯例实为霸王条款财经频道新华网" )]

##  LV等洋品牌耍大牌 说是国际惯例实为霸王条款财经频道新华网

湖北日报讯 （记者余瑾毅、实习生朱芸霞、通讯员高峰）部分奢侈品正遭遇着和他们的知名度不相符的质疑。昨日，记者从武汉市工商局江岸分局获悉，奢侈品品牌路易威登专
卖店在近2个月间被3次投诉，退货规定被指“大牌强势”，奢侈品消费维权困境日渐凸显。6月，康女士在沿江大道LV专卖店购买了一款价值16000元的皮包,[pau
l smith men](http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/
"http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/" )，使用了10天发现皮包脱线，康女士要求退货。但专卖店认为，全球的LV店都不退货，况
且脱线可能是消费者使用不当造成，需送检确定原因。除非质量问题严重到无法修复，才能退货，否则只能免费修补，或调换等值其他货品。

据了解，根据我国产品退换的“三包”规定，产品售出后7天或15天内，出现质量问题，消费者可以选择退货、换货或修理。但进入中国的奢侈品,[abercrombie
en france](http://www.pascherabercrombiefr.com/
"http://www.pascherabercrombiefr.com/" )，出现质量问题时，多要将产品送回原产国或本公司鉴定，确定问题责任方，但这种“
既当球员，又当裁判”的做法令康女士难以信服检测结果。LV武汉负责人称，如果怀疑检测结果，消费者可自到我国权威检测部门送检。

江岸区工商介绍,不仅是LV，江岸区数家奢侈品店自开店来，都曾因同样的问题被投诉过，奢侈品退货难完全成了“国际惯例”。

对于这类维权怪圈，武汉武珞律师事务所陈冠男认为，外来奢侈品不应特殊化，应该与中国产品一样遵守中国“三包”规定。工商和质监部门，应定期抽检其产品，从货品来源和
产品质量上先行保护消费者。

&lt;/span&gt;

但武汉产品质量监督检验所介绍说，商品使用过程中会造成损耗，为了出具无偏差的检验报告，检验只针对新品。如果一定要维权，只能拿新品送检。若嫌价格太高,[jord
an 11 shoes](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/"
)，可以要求LV提供新样品检测。对此,[paulsmith outlet](http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/
"http://www.paulsmithestoreuk.com/" )，LV专卖店表示拒绝。“如果无法确定质量问题责任是LV公司,[ray ban rb
3025](http://www.raybaneyeglassesoutlet.com/
"http://www.raybaneyeglassesoutlet.com/" )，不能介入处罚，只能调解。”工商部门也陷执法困境。

WASHINGTON, Dec.five (Xinhua) -- NASA's Kepler mission has confirmed its first
planet in the "habitable zone," a region where fluid water could exist aboard
a planet's surface, the U.S.area agent announced aboard Monday.  
  
  
  
The newly-confirmed planet, Kepler-22b,is the smallest additionally pedestal
to orbit in the medium of the habitable zone of a star similar apt Sun. The
planet namely almost 2.4 times the radius of Earth. Scientists don't
additionally comprehend if Kepler-22b has a predominantly rocky, gaseous or
fluid composition,[ルブタンメンズ](http://www.louboutinjapanstore.com/
"http://www.louboutinjapanstore.com/" ),merely its breakthrough namely a tread
closer apt finding Earth-like planets.  
  
Previous research clued by the existence of near-Earth-size planets in
habitable zones,[ポールスミス 財布 レディース](http://www.paulsmithesalejapan.com/
"http://www.paulsmithesalejapan.com/" ),but explicit confirmation certified
impalpable Two other small planets orbiting stars smaller and cooler than Sun
recently were confirmed on the quite corners of the habitable zone, with
orbits more closely resembling those of Venus and Mars.  
  
"This that a major milestone aboard the road apt discovery Earth's dual said
Douglas Hudgins, Kepler agenda scientist by the NASA Headquarters in
Washington. "Kepler's results continue apt demonstrate the importance of
NASA's science missions, which purpose apt answer some of the biggest
questions nearly our position in the macrocosm"  
  
Kepler discovers planets and planet candidates along measuring dips in the
sunlight of more than 150,000 stars to quest as planets that along in
front,or"transit," the stars. Kepler requires by least three transits to
verify a signal as a planet.  
  
"Fortune smiled upon us with the detection of this
planet,[靴ティンバーランド](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/

Kepler-22b. "The 1st transit was captured equitable three days next we
declared the spacecraft operationally ready We witnessed the defining third
transit over the 2010 vacation season."  
  
The Kepler science crew uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space
Telescope apt reiterate observations aboard planet candidates the spacecraft
finds. The star field that Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and
Lyra tin only be seen from ground-based observatories in spring through early
fall. The data from these other observations support make sure which
candidates can be validated as planets.  
  
Kepler-22b namely located 600 light annuals away. While the planet namely
larger than Earth, its orbit of 290 days nearly a Sun-like star resembles that
of Earth. The planet's host star belongs to the same class as Sun,cried
G-type,whatsoever it that slightly smaller and cooler.  
  
Of the 54 habitable-zone planet candidates reported in February 2011, Kepler-

BEIJING, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Eating at a Beijing snack namely usually 1
adventure for foreigners, and especially while they obtain the accident apt
order fowl without sex life"or"ruddy scalded lion brain"  
  
Sometimes incited but mostly confused, embarrassed or even afraid many
foreigners have long complained almost mistranslations of Chinese dishes And
their complaints are often legal certainly regarding fowl without sex life" as
it's really equitable tender juvenile fowl and ruddy flamed lion head is
braised pork pellet among brown sauce.  
  
But such one experience at Beijing's restaurants ambition clearly soon be
history.  
  
Foreign visitors want no longer, hopefully, be confused by oddly worded
cafeteria menus surrounded the central whether the civic government's lay apt
correctly translate 3,000 Chinese dishes namely a success and the translations
are generally adopted.  
  
The civic bureau of foreign businesses has published a paperback to suggest
English translations of Chinese dishes which intentions to assistance
restaurants avoid peculiar translations.  
  
It's the city's latest effort apt bridge the civilization gap for foreign
travellers among China.  
  
The municipal government published a alike account of translations ahead the
Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, and suggested it apt starred hotels across the

they are eating and how it is prepared said Chen Lin, professor by the Beijing
Foreign Studies University.  
  
Coming up with accurate translations namely a daunting task, as some Chinese
culinary techniques are untranslatable and many Chinese trays have no English-
language equivalent.  
  
The translators,afterward conducting a study of Chinese restaurants amid
English-speaking nations divided the dish names into four categories:
ingredients,[ジョーダン シューズ](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" ), cooking method taste and appoint of a
person alternatively a place.  
  
For some traditional dishes

system,is acclimate such as mapo tofu formerly constantly literally translated

and jiaozi (dumplings) to"reflect the Chinese cuisine

must rack my brains trying apt explain Chinese dishes to foreign travellers,"
said Zheng Xiaodong, a 31-year-old hired with a Beijing-based peregrination
proxy.  
  
"I want purchase the paperback as I major surrounded English literature and
I'd prefer apt introduce Chinese cuisine civilization apt more foreign
friends," said Han Yang, a postgraduate student at the University of
International Business and Economics.  
  
It namely never explicit whether the paperback ambition be introduced apt
additional chapters of China. But on Tuesday,[paul smith

##  Nobel laureate doubts results of faster-than-light neutrino

BEIJING,[timberland roll top](http://www.timberlandjapanboots.com/
"http://www.timberlandjapanboots.com/" ), Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- A Nobel
laureate aboard Monday doubted the results of a European experiment that
demonstrated the aptitude of neutrinos to move faster than the velocity of
light during one interview among preparation as the 2011 Nobel Laureates
Beijing Forum.  
  
"I'm willing apt wager money that it's never
correct,[フェラガモベルト](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/specials.html
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/specials.html" )," said Professor George Smoot
III,[バーバリー マフラー](http://www.burberryjapanonline.com/
"http://www.burberryjapanonline.com/" ), winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize within
Physics and a professor by the University of California.  
  
Prof. Smoot was referring apt the OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-
tRacking Apparatus) experiment conducted last annual by the CERN Super Proton
Synchrotron within Geneva and the Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) underground
laboratory among capital
Italy,[クリスチャンルブタン](http://www.japanlouboutinshoes.com/products_new.html
"http://www.japanlouboutinshoes.com/products_new.html" ), located virtually
730 km away from Geneva.  
  
In one fable published aboard Sept. 22 among the technological daily"Nature,"
European researchers stated that neutrinos,alternatively electrically neutral
subatomic molecules traveling between the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron and
the LNGS laboratory reached speeds greater than the speed of light.  
  
Smoot said that their demands"did never tell sense" and should be verified
along other scientists 1st.  
  
"There are many distortions among physics. You must have a very lofty
criterion apt see whether something namely really correct," he said.  
  
If proven true,[トリーバーチ シューズ](http://www.toryburchjapanonline.com/specials.html
"http://www.toryburchjapanonline.com/specials.html" ), the researchers' claims
would contradict Einstein's theory of special relativity, a academic
foundation of modern physics which states that nothing can peregrination
faster than light. Other scientists, as well as the OPERA team themselves,
have voiced doubts regarding the experiment's results.

Only diplomacy can resolve Iran-West row" )]

##  Only diplomacy can resolve Iran-West row

By Wang Hui  
  
BEIJING,Dec.three (Xinhuanet) -- The gap between Britain and Iran has
snowballed into a major diplomatic tempest,devouring the two countries as well
as Britain's allies in Europe and beyond.  
  
The latest row was kindled aboard Tuesday after thousands of angry Iranian
protesters stormed into British diplomatic compounds in Teheran. The highest
maniacal protest opposition the West in extra than three decades set off a
fetter of reactions from Britain, its leagues in Europe and the United States.  
  
The relationship between Teheran and London has deteriorated steadily as of
the standoff between Iran and the West over its nuclear programme An
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report released aboard Nov 18
declared that Iran was continuing to enhance its nuclear weapons capacity and
might still be conducting hidden research apt amplify a nuclear bombard.  
  
The report prompted the US and the European Union, including Britain,[ポールスミス
長財布 メンズ](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ),to impose present economic sanctions
aboard Iran. In response, Iran downgraded its diplomatic ties with Britain two
days forward the aggression on the British diplomatic compounds.  
  
The current sanctions against Teheran intensified anti-West emotions in Iran,
lighting the fuse of the latest row between the West and Iran. The Iranian
government publicly expressed repent over the "unacceptable behavior of the
protesters. But Britain believes that the attacks could never have taken area
without the backing of the Iranian authorities.  
  
On Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague mandated the immediate
closure of the Iranian embassy in London and demanded that its staff leave
Britain surrounded 48 hours. France, Germany and the Netherlands soon recalled
their ambassadors for consultations,while Italy namely mulling catching the
same course.  
  
Regrettably, the ongoing diplomatic row between Iran and the Western powers
shows not sign of abating, pushing Iran's relationship with the West to a
present low On Thursday, the EU tightened sanctions opposition Iran and was
considering levying an obstruction aboard Iranian oil The same daytime the US
Senate passed harsher measures opposition Iran, aiming apt cut off Iran's
chief bank from the universal financial system.  
  
It seems that the US and European nations are driven by boost instead of
rationality, in their relationship with Iran. If the countries contained in
the row do never punishment restraint and refrain from catching extra drastic
action in retaliation,[paul smith handbag](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" ), tension want continue apt construct
in the already strained Gulf region.  
  
Worse, the prospects of settling the issue peacefully amongst international
exertions will penetrate gloomier and the region longing be moved closer apt a
combat.  
  
To discourage tensions from escalating,always parties need apt calm
down,[ティンバーランド アウトレット](http://www.timberlandjapanstore.com/
"http://www.timberlandjapanstore.com/" ),avert catching impulsive action and
fall back aboard elastic foreign affairs The parties ought comply along the
norms and principles of international relations,for dialogue and consultation
have always been the best access to decide conflicts and contentions.  
  
The new circuitous of conflict has its root in the long-standing enmity
between the West and Iran, which started in 1979 with the Islamic revolution
and chaotic seizure of the US embassy in Teheran.  
  
In recent annuals US-led Western countries have nourished gigantic oppression
aboard Iran. The rampant anti-US sentiments between Iranians and Teheran's
suspected nuclear agenda have made the nation an eyesore as the West. Since
2006, the US has forced the passage of four rounds of UN-authorized sanctions
opposition Iran. Even ahead the IAEA report was released last month, American
and Israeli officials had implied at (even issued threats of) launching naval
strikes opposition Iran. Besides,[フェラガモ
バッグ](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_new.html
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_new.html" ), the US namely
strengthening its naval presence in the Gulf region.  
  
With the three-decade-old animosity aggravated along new feuds,[ポールスミス
ベルト](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
), it seems the smoke of battle namely gathering over the Gulf,production it
always the extra important as the international community apt tread up its
meditation efforts apt discourage the diplomatic war from turning into a real
battle.  
  
With its geographic advantage and special area in oil supply Iran that
especially important to truce and stability in the Middle East. It melodramas
an important temperament in the earth economy,also Many nations including some
in the West,rely aboard Iran for a majority of their fuel imports.  
  
The Western powers are anyhow in the throes of an of the worst economic
crises. Financial constraints have forced the US to start dragging out of
Iraq, and it has decided to do the same in Afghanistan.  
  
So whether the diplomatic row between the West and Iran worsens and leads apt
a combat it longing serve no country's beguile.

Let market solve Taobao Mall dispute" )]

##  Let market solve Taobao Mall dispute

BEIJING, Oct 19 (Xinhuanet) --The recent online discussion between Taobao Mall
and some of its small and medium-sized vendors highlights the urgency of
establishing sound and fully market-based advertisement rules, said a South
Metropolis Daily editorial. The following are excerpts:  
  
Bitter online fare discussion between Taobao Mall, the country's guiding
online retail platform, and its small and medium-sized retailers namely
calming down emulating the intervention of the Ministry of Commerce.  
  
On Monday, Taobao Mall announced revised fees, including a 9-month elegance
duration for normal sellers who have maintained good-looking
ratings,[クリスチャンルブタン セール](http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/" ), and a one.eight billion yuan ($282.2
million) investment plan apt help the evolution of small and medium-sized
enterprises.  
  
The conciliatory migrate came a day subsequently the Ministry of Commerce
ordered Taobao to respond to vendors' demands.  
  
The result of the discussion namely dramatic,but in some ways it follows
China's national conditions. Its accommodation once afresh demonstrates that
anytime two market players in China cannot judge their disputes amongst
negotiations alternatively mall rules,one side entire corners to the
administration for mediation or intervention.  
  
Such a prototype that onward not means an encouraging phenomenon for those who
advocate the full character of the mall.  
  
In this discussion Taobao Mall's small and medium-sized sellers were in a
languid and adverse position until the latest announcement along the online
retail giant. Facing potentially huge losses, these dealers chose to lash out
by their larger-sized counterparts to some extent that contravened market
principles. Such behavior has invited editorial from some traditional media.  
  
But the protest of these Taobao vendors has successfully converted their
purely economic discussion with their more powerful cooperative companion into
a nationwide argue about the survival of waiter small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) and even nearly reform of China's e-commerce sector.  
  
In this process,[ティンバーランド サンダル](http://www.timberlandjapanboots.com/
"http://www.timberlandjapanboots.com/" ), the perplexing situation facing
these retailers and their complaint that Taobao Mall intends to abandon them
subsequently amplifying into an e-commerce giant with their extensive
participation has garnered nationwide sympathy from grassroots netizens.  
  
At the same period the collective "online unrest they launched has reflected
the bigger context within which some maid SMEs are struggling apt survive.  
  
If no moral criteria are considered, the vendors who participated amid last
week's online manoeuvre employed successful tactics,as they were well aware
that a head-on confrontation with the more powerful Taobao would be futile
They were likewise conscious that in the power bureaucracy of Chinese society
the administration holds a dominant position, and that the balance of power
would shift to them whether the authority could be introduced into the debate
on their side.  
  
Certainly,[ティンバーランドジャパン](http://www.timberlandjapanstore.com/
"http://www.timberlandjapanstore.com/" ), this namely never a tactic these
vendors inevitably wanted apt employ from the very beginning. However,[財布
バーバリー](http://www.burberryjapanonline.com/products_new.html
"http://www.burberryjapanonline.com/products_new.html" ), it namely an
undeniable truth that such a tactic has chanced the main manner as some small
enterprises trying apt survive among China's new advertisement environment.  
  
In this context, once their interests are by hazard of being compromised, any
mall players aspiration paucity apt transform their purely economic disputes
with other players into an with the participation of the ministry It is their
faith that authority intervention longing outcome amid the reversal of the
rules of the game.  
  
For the ministry it that also willing to activity the temperament of mediator
for the sake of its own interests. This was reflected according government's
persona within the acquisition discussion between Wahaha, a Chinese drink
corporation and its business associate Danone, a French edible giant.  
  
The propagation of such a dispute-settling model indicates forever mall
players among China ambition conversation of adherence apt mall rules,barely
always longing offer apt sabotage them whether these rules certify unfavorable
apt them.  
  
To alter such an embarrassing situation, a entirely and well-developed mall
consciousness ought be built between all mall participants,[paul smith
スーツ](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
), given that any victory based aboard the damaging of market rules ambition
not last long. At the same period the ministry ought acquaint pressing efforts
apt build and improve mall rules.

selling by small companies aboard the servant mall and adviser apt a short-

Several companies have said that the invoices will be launched in November by

nonferrous metals information provider Shanghai Metals Market.  
  
Lai Zhaotian,proxy prevalent manager of Ganzhou Rare Earth Mineral Industry
Co, a State-owned maker of the metals in the infrequent earth-rich Jiangxi
province, said that the company hasn't received any notice from the
authorities.  
  
The introduction of such invoices would be in tune with the country's stricter
policies to control the expensive minerals. China namely the world's biggest
supplier of infrequent earths, and it holds more than 30 percent of absolute
globe keeps.  
  
"We expect that the merit of the invoices longing be closely connected with
each company's production and export rations which longing absent from highest
of the small producers and traders and let a few mammoth exploration and
separation companies stand out as qualified," said Liu Minda, an analyst of
nonferrous metals at Huatai Securities Co Ltd.  
  
The receipts, commonly known in China as fapiao,[ルブタン

), are used chiefly apt construct the official merit of a transaction as tax
purposes.

conveyances and cell calls rose as much as fourfold between January and July
aboard the backward of China's tightened measures apt control production and
export quotas as the sector.  
  
Prices afterward plunged after the earlier surge eroded downstream players'
profits and led to overstocking.  
  
Figures compiled by Shanghai Metals Market showed that the average prices of
infrequent earth oxides declined by almost 30 percent in the past three
months, with some dripping more than 50 percent.  
  
The introduction of the current invoices might further dilute prices in the
coming months,for some small companies that cannot acquire the specialized
invoices longing must sell their inventories apt cash in and overflow the
market Wei said.  
  
However, such present measures ambition in the long run yield a better-
regulated manufacture with speculators forced apt exit the mall and illegal
miners left with few channels apt sell their productions without allowable
invoices, Wei said.  
  
Given the scarcity of these resources, the strategically important infrequent
earths want ultimately be dominated by a few huge servant companies, Liu said.  
  
The State Council issued a directive in May shrieking as the biggest domestic
producers to dominate the mall in two years,[ルブタン

BEIJING,[timberland outlet stores](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" ), Nov. 24 (Xinhuanet) -- Libya's
National Transitional Council (NTC) labeled a fashionable government aboard
Tuesday, three days afterward Saif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan leader
Muammar Gadhafi was captured. Saif namely the last important Gadhafi family
membership apt be collared alternatively killed On Sunday, the Libyan rebels
took former Libyan master-spy Abdullah Sanusi prisoner.  
  
The arrest of Saif and Sanusi,however are not significant within post-Gadhafi
era Libya. And offensive the controversy over whether Saif ought be tried by
the NTC within Tripoli or the International Criminal Court surrounded The
Hague, his trial, too,ambition never be important. At best, the developments
are part of the final part of Libya's civil war which incidentally could be
long.  
  
Forces that remain invariable to Gadhafi may have lost always hope of turning
things approximately merely the conflict within Libya namely far from over.
Instead of being an efficacious central administration, the NTC that a lax
alliance of by least four political teams - democrats,[men timberland
boots](http://www.timberlandausale.com/ "http://www.timberlandausale.com/" ),
tribal representatives, former royalists and Islamic extremists, which
virtually have anything in common additional than being anti-Gadhafi.  
  
There are great distinctions among them, with the widest being between
democrats and tribal chiefs and Islamic extremists.  
  
The democrats hope apt introduce modern Western democracy and the tribal
chiefs and Islamic extremists deficiency to re-establish traditional society
regulated by Islamic decree There are smaller merely unbridgeable gaps between
alter tribes too.  
  
The NTC does never have the power and wherewithal apt control them. According
to reports,when NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil conveyed a discourse in
Tripoli within September, he could never even block his forces from shooting
amid celebration approximate the Martyrs' Square.  
  
Besides, the prevailing regime absences professional, qualified and seasoned
civilian officials apt fill the vacant posts surrounded the administration and
other sectors of the country,only such folk are infrequent amid Libya for
Gadhafi devastated the modern state apparatus during his 42-year conviction
With always political parties being banned since 1972,[timberland
rolltop](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" ), the Libyan people have no
experience of modern politics and longing find it exceedingly complex apt
develop a healthy political atmosphere.  
  
Economic problem was an important factor as Gadhafi's breakdown Libya's per
capita GDP was $13,000 ahead the civil war merely its unemployment rate
approached 30 percent forcing energetic only unemployed young people to take
up weapon against Gadhafi.  
  
But the same youngsters,[キーケース ポールスミス](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ),instantly armed with guns can
occasion beyond social unrest whether they cannot find employment. Just a week
antecedent a pistol battle between rival militias wrecked out approximate
Tripoli and lasted four days leaving many folk dead.  
  
The NTC has to restore social order before it namely too late. And the only
way it can do so that by reviving the economy and building more jobs, which
will be even more challenging for it than it was as Gadhafi. The International
Monetary Fund has said Libya's economic activities have shrunk by more than
half for of the civilian battle and crude fuel production, which accounts for
more than 70 percentage of the economy, cannot resume until the second half of
2012. Falling fuel prices among the international market could acquaint
matters even exasperate for the NTC.  
  
Also,diverse Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya cannot think aboard ponderous dole
from the Unites States or its Western leagues as its reconstruction,for they
are fighting their own crises. Iraq and Afghanistan have shown that the cheap
rate of profit during reconstruction of a war-torn land is of micro attraction
to mercenary private main Besides,foreigner governments may not be eager to
help within Libya's reconstruction as the experiences amid Iraq and
Afghanistan are still fresh within their memory.  
  
Foreign naval help, too,longing never last long. In truth the "Libya
prototype"that a special case amid modern international politics and can
neither last long neither be copied. NATO has broken the international verdict
and violated the UN Security Council resolution by bombarding Libya
intensively. So it has no alternative merely apt recede immediately that
Gadhafi namely dead.  
  
Moreover, the ponderous burden of waging a battle against Gadhafi has been a
drain on Western economies. According apt latest data, the Libya mission had
spent France $413 million by October. Perhaps that's why NATO ended its
naval"mission"about immediately then Gadhafi's death.  
  
Therefore,next overthrowing Gadhafi, the Libyan people swiftly find themselves
facing another complicated task, that of building a prevailing democratic and
prosperous nation.  
  
But that has made an thing clear: A nation can create democracy and accomplish
prosperity only through the efforts of its own folk and not amongst the
interference of foreign countries.

##  针对6款假冒产品，LV索赔240万

在华美达酒店的店铺中，真品价格4万多元的6款产品，只要4500多元就能买到。LV公司认为，该酒店内店铺涉案产品侵犯了公司的8项商标权,[ルブタン
新作](http://www.louboutinjapanvogue.com/products_new.html
"http://www.louboutinjapanvogue.com/products_new.html" )。
&lt;P&gt;**针对6款假冒产品，LV索赔240万 **&lt;P&gt;LV公司代理人在庭上出示了涉嫌假冒的证据：2个手袋、2个挎包、1个钱包、一条
皮带。其中，钱包没有对应的真品。根据估算，这几款商品的正品价格约为45000元，而华美达酒店商铺的售价仅4500元，是正品的十分之一。
&lt;P&gt;昨日庭审时，LV公司称，这6件商品侵犯了LV的8种商标，包括文字图形、花纹设计等，针对这8种侵权他们提出各30万元,共240万元的索赔。 
&lt;P&gt;除了经济赔偿外，LV公司还要求华美达酒店停止销售侵权商品，销毁库存或待销售商品；在媒体和酒店大堂张贴、示牌等方式向原告公开赔礼道歉、消除影
响。 &lt;P&gt; ** 酒店辩称：店内商铺售假与己无关 **&lt;P&gt;面对指控，华美达酒店将责任推到了“第三者”——酒店内商铺承租方的身上。
酒店代理人称，涉案商品是承租户销售的，虽然在租赁协议中，双方明确约定不销售违法商品，但承租户在酒店不知情的情况下销售,[ルブタン](http://www.l
ouboutinjapanheels.com/ "http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/"
)，酒店也没有办法。“我们不清楚涉案商品的进货渠道、进货数量，只是根据租赁合同的约定来管理商铺，而租赁合同上并没有约定要对进货行为进行把关。”
&lt;P&gt;针对这项辩解，LV方面称，仅凭一张酒店承租协议的复印件，不能确定这个所谓的承租者是否存在。因为涉案商品的付款方式是刷卡,[ジョーダン
シューズ](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/ "http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/"
)，收款方显示是华美达酒店。而在消费过程中，销售人员也一再称，商场是由酒店开设的。 &lt;P&gt;**要买真品，只能通过专卖店和官网
**&lt;P&gt;6款假冒商品，竟要240万元的索赔，这会不会太“天价”了？ &lt;P&gt;面对记者的疑问，LV公司代理律师表示，华美达酒店对外宣称
准五星，顾客正是LV公司的目标客户群，因此在其酒店内销售假LV产品比路边地摊上销售的假LV，对LV公司产生的负面影响更大，因此才会索要高额的赔偿金。
&lt;P&gt;代理律师表示，原告的由字母LOUIS VUITTON组成的文字商标已经使用了150余年，成为世界驰名的商标。经续展注册，该注册商标目前的有
效期自2006年1月15日至2016年1月14日，原告依法在中国境内享有该商标的专用权。为保证原告商品在与品牌价值相称的高档次销售环境销售，原告生产的产品只
在原告自营的路易威登专卖店和官方网站www.louisvuitton.com销售。
&lt;P&gt;华美达酒店表示，涉案商品除了LV公司鉴定为假外，并没有经过其他相关鉴定机构的确认，并对赔偿金额不予认同。
&lt;P&gt;昨天，双方争执不下，最终未能达成调解意愿,&lt;a
href="<http://www.louboutinjapanvogue.com/>" style="color: black; text-

&lt;P&gt;四星级酒店里,[timberlands](http://www.timberlandausale.com/
"http://www.timberlandausale.com/" )，售卖假LV？昨天上午，法国名牌路易威登马利蒂（Louis Vuitton
Malletier，简称LV）将杭州华玫达酒店有限公司告上杭州滨江区人民法院，索赔240万元。

##  NBA：林书豪18投5中7助攻 低迷尼克斯遭受五连败

&lt;P&gt;新华网纽约3月11日体育专电（记者张荣锋）尽管尼克斯大中锋钱德勒归队，但纽约没能止住下滑颓势，11日以94:106主场不敌费城76人，遭遇
五连败。 &lt;P&gt;尼克斯整体陷入低迷，没有任何亮点。林书豪全场18次投篮，只命中5球，得到14分和7次助攻，失误高达6次。安东尼得到全队最高的22
分,[ルブタン](http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/" )，但命中率偏低。尼克斯缺乏流畅的配合，多以单打为主，全队命中率只有41%。
&lt;P&gt;76人全场12次抢断，总体命中率超过五成，三分命中率高达56%，轻松赢球完全在情理之中,[nike air jordan
xiii](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/"
)。替补出场的路易斯·威廉姆斯砍下全场最高的28分；前锋特纳和伊戈达拉分别得到24分和19分。76人五人得分上双。 &lt;P&gt;第一节，林书豪前三投都
偏出。直到比赛进行到最后3分钟时，林书豪突破上篮并造犯规，完成2+1后取得个人得分，帮助尼克斯建立了19:12的领先。安东尼手感炙热，7投5中，得到12分。
但尼克斯失误偏多，第一节共有5次。最后两分钟，替补上场没有任何表现，纽约的优势很快被缩小到两分，以24:22结束第一节。 &lt;P&gt;第二节，两队经历
了两次平分。76人成功抢断后，伊戈达拉快攻扣篮。76人42:40反超。这也成为本场比赛的转折点。此后76人又连续抢断，一度确立起6分优势。尼克斯连得6分后拉
平比分。威廉姆斯投中压哨球，76人51:49领先结束上半场。本节安东尼和林书豪都无多大建树，只是通过罚球分别得到2分。上半场尼克斯共被抢断8次。林书豪6投1
中,[ナイキ ジョーダン](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" )，得到5分,[discount
timberland](http://www.timberlandausale.com/

，让对手单节得到38分。林书豪7投两中，教练德安东尼将其换下。76人的威廉姆斯连续命中两个三分，76人领先16分结束第三节。
&lt;P&gt;第四节，尼克斯前五投都没能命中，直到林书豪突破上篮才打破僵局，但始终未能形成翻盘局面，最后以94:106败北,[フェラガモ

"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" )，遭遇五连败。 &lt;P&gt;尼克斯主教练德安东尼赛后指责球员在场上的专
注度不够，有时候如同“梦游”，或者是“脱离正轨”。目前尼克斯只领先东区排名第九的雄鹿一场半，季后赛席位受到威胁。 &lt;P&gt;尼克斯接下来的赛程形势严
峻：12日客场对公牛凶多吉少；14日主场面对开拓者有翻身的机会。如果对开拓者一战不能获胜，接下来同步行者的两场较量将更不容乐观。

BEIJING, Feb. 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhai Jun began apt
admit with Syrian officials and against groups Saturday,aboard a mission apt
beyond expound on China's stance aboard the Syria issue.  
  
Zhai's visit came after China balloted against a draft resolution aboard Syria
by the UN General Assembly on Thursday,less than two weeks then China and
Russia vetoed a alike chart at the Security Council aboard Feb.four.  
  
The nonbinding resolution adopted at the General Assembly aids a political
transition among Syria.  
  
A sober-minded learn of the overall,perplexing situation among Syria would
acquaint it easy for folk to see the abounding justification for China's
opposition apt the resolutions,though it has drawn critique from some Western
countries.  
  
For a start China believes, as much others do,[フェラガモ
メンズ](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ), there that still wish the Syria
emergency can be decided through peaceable dialogue between the against and
the ministry contrary to some Western countries' contention that duration
namely escaping out as talks among Syria.  
  
Among Syria's assorted against groups some have voiced willingness to grasp
dialogue with the Syrian ministry and likewise warned those seeking outdoor
intervention against becoming a tool of the West.  
  
However, their shrieks for peaceable inter-Syrian dialogue have been largely
ignored, intentionally alternatively unintentionally,within Western middles
reports, which convey the wrong impression that there is an overwhelming
consensus between revise factions of the against forces that they paucity
emigrant intervention among their country.  
  
Secondly,as Syria, a hotchpotch of revise faiths sects and tribes resorting
apt foreigner intervention namely unlikely to generate a poised and inclusive
solution that satisfies everyone.  
  
Worse still, it threatens to ratchet up sectarian tensions, plunging this yet
volatile country into a bloodier civilian battle and spreading violence across
the region.  
  
Besides, previous cases show that blatant outer intervention has invested few
episodes of truce and rumble as promised by the West.  
  
Blood is still being shed among Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan, where foreigner
forces have intervened and come to"help." Not a alone day passes without
innocent people undergoing from violence among these countries,annihilated
alternatively maimed and instead of creating the future of their matherland
highest of them appear instantly resigned apt their fate.  
  
From this outlook China's rejection of foreign intervention is the expression
of legitimate concerns likewise shared by much from the international
community.  
  
The West,aboard the contrary,[ティンバーランド靴2012](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinej
p.com/products_new.html
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/products_new.html" ), appears to be
driven fewer by their self-proclaimed high goal" of liberalizing the Syrian
folk than onward geopolitical considerations.  
  
Given Syria's strategic importance among the Middle East - adjacent Turkey,
Jordan, Iraq, Israel and Lebanon, as well as its near ties with Iran and
Lebanon's armed crew Hezbollah, some Western powers have long remained hostile
to the Assad administration bent aboard bringing it down.  
  
As the Syria crisis continues to fester, the West has naturally pushed apt
seek "regime change surrounded Syria within a command apt isolate Iran and
Hezbollah, their antagonists amid the region,[paul smith
sale](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ),thus tipping the regional
equilibrium of power among their favor.  
  
However,votes never ammunition would bring boom to folk nearly the world.  
  
The best thing outsiders can do namely apt create a fair external environment
that would facilitate one early advent of truce and prosperity among Syria.  
  
Interventionism according some Western countries would only impede efforts to
find a credible and inclusive solution to the emergency and inflame an but
volatile situation there.

提高服务水平获得患者信任

** 记者：**在收支不平衡的情况下，专业人士是否仍然愿意在此工作？ 

**■人物简介 MYMIND创始人兼执行总裁。**

中国工作点首选大城市

** 记者：**MYMIND并不是医院，如何处理一些紧急情况？ 

** KrystianFikert：**求助者肯定会有不满意的情况。单从技术上来说，比如网站注册等等。关于治疗方面，如果遇到投诉等问题，他们会选择先检查心理专家对求助者的治疗过程是否符合求助者本身的情况，如果的确是专家在治疗程序或其他方面出现问题，我们可以给求助者进行更换。

**KrystianFikert：**其实很多人不太希望面对面或在电话中，表明自己是一个精神有问题的人，他们不愿意被别人认为自己存在一些精神疾病，但是相较于电话沟通，打字就没有任何问题，他们可以把自己作为第三方，比如他们会在网上采取匿名的方式，或重新申请一个邮箱地址，与MYMIND的工作人员交流。我们会先采取网上交流的方式，等到时机成熟，求助者放下心理负担的时候，再约请电话沟通或面对面的心理治疗。 

我们赚取付费客户的资金用于帮助那些不能全额付款的心理求助者。

**KrystianFikert：**对于一些需要心理健康支持的人，可能在３到４个工作日内就可以与心理治疗专家进行面对面的沟通，其次就是经济实惠，一般对于求助者，分为三个等级，第一个等级是普通人都可以支付得起的费用，这个价格大约只是公共医疗的一半，第二个等级是对于有社会低保的一些人，价格会更低，第三个等级则是对于一些贫困人群,[ポールスミス カードケース](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" )，我们直接提供给他们免费的治疗。 

2月17日，MYMIND创始人兼执行总裁KrystianFikert首次来到中国，推介他的公益组织模式，这个在爱尔兰成长起来的公益组织，通过建立网站解决当地
人群的心理健康问题。作为一个非营利性的社会企业，借助“富取贫济”式的运作模式，帮助那些被抑郁、焦虑或是工作压力困扰的求助者。自2006年起，这个组织从仅有一
个人和一个网络平台，已经发展到现在拥有40人的团队，MYMIND累计为超过4000人提供了心理健康支持，目前MYMIND的创始人来到中国，希望在这里建立一个
心灵小屋，利用互联网的优势，让更多人可以获得心理救助。

――KrystianFikert

** 记者：**中国区域差别很大，贫困地区有很大的缺口，在这些方面MYMIND有没有一些想法？ 

** KrystianFikert：**信任需要逐步建立，这也是在线咨询的优势之一，求助者发来信息进行求助，这是求助者跨出自己心理障碍的第一步，在这个时候，我们给出相应的解决办法，如果这个答案对于他们有意义，他们就会要求进行面对面的沟通。还有很重要的一个因素就是口碑，有一些求助者在这里经过治疗以后，觉得还不错，他们也可以选择在网络上进行一些回馈，同时我们也会在公共交通及杂志上刊登广告。 

**记者**：MYMIND有哪些优势能为患者解决他们的心理问题？ 

**KrystianFikert：**万事开头难，一开始我们没有地方、也没有资金、没有客户资源也没有团队，所以很难吸引到一些人。 

** 记者：**有些患者可能碍于面子问题羞于求助，你是怎么说服他们去接受心理咨询的？ 

因此2006年我创立了MYMIND,[クリスチャンルブタン 名古屋](http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/"
)，它向每个人开放，目前在都柏林的两个社区内运行，除了面对面的心理咨询，还提供在线的心理及精神健康服务。

MYMIND注重的是早期干预，尽量不使用药物治疗。心理健康早期干预包含抑制抑郁情绪、焦虑症状等等，我们认为早期干预有助于更好的心理治疗结果，以防这些心理健康
问题升级。

在爱尔兰的公共医疗方面，患者可能需要等待６到８个月甚至更长的时间，才能与心理医生进行约见，但如果选用私人治疗，患者需要支付昂贵的服务费用给私人心理治疗师。同
时，一些爱尔兰人会因自己存有心理问题感觉羞愧，不愿意接受心理治疗,[エアジョーダン13](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com
/ "http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" )，导致问题越来越严重。

对于我来说，最难的还是进行MYMIND的经营，我本身并不擅长商业经营，本专业也并不在此，因此，在这方面我还是一个初学者，需要继续学习。

** KrystianFikert：**是的。我们有22名职业的心理学专家、2名心理医生和16名心理咨询师及辅导员。心理专家与我们的合作不是全天的，根据他们的情况，有的可能一周只工作３到５个小时，虽然在这里得到的薪酬肯定要比他们自己的正式工作低很多，但大部分人还是很愿意坚持下去。在爱尔兰，很多人还是认为，从社会中获得一些利益以后，也有责任为社会回馈一些。从MYMIND这个机构自身来说，我们也有很好的管理方式，可以协调各个专家的时间，让他们可以与正式工作分开，安心在MYMIND工作。 

** KrystianFikert：**一种方案还是进行在线咨询。目前，在线医生和在线咨询也很流行，医生可以通过网络、摄像头或者其他方式在城市中为位于很远的人提供这样的治疗；另一种方案解决这样的问题，可以培训一些专业人士，但从长远角度来看，这样花费的时间以及经历都过于长。因此我们还是会把工作站设立在大一点的城市，通过招募城市中的志愿者为更多更远地区的人们提供服务。 

**KrystianFikert：**主要的求助群体，其实还是一些轻微心理健康困扰的人，比如抑郁或有自杀倾向的人，如果遇到一些患有严重心理疾病的人，我们也会把他们转到正规医院去进行治疗，因此MYMIND跟当地一些医院都有合作，有些时候，医院也会向一些人推荐到MYMIND。

** 记者：**MYMIND的运作模式在中国的可行性高吗？ 

&lt;img style="BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 0px
solid; BORDER-TOP: #000000 0px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 0px solid"

width="399" height="264" /&gt;

** KrystianFikert：**大约超过15％的爱尔兰人会面临一些心理健康问题，而爱尔兰心理健康卫生系统并没有足够的能力可以解决这一日益增长的现状。 

我曾经有两年供职于谷歌，利用空闲开展MYMIND的工作。一开始我把工作地点设在了教堂旁边的一间小屋里，因为是免费提供的，后来有人愿意跟我一起,[air
jordans six rings](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/" )
，我们就开始租日租房，每个周末为更多的人提供服务。直到2008年，才有了固定的工作站。刚开始的时候我们也没有这个在线咨询系统，虽然我本身学的是心理学专业，但
我对电脑也很感兴趣，经过一段时间努力，通过自学，我自己设计了网站，从最开始，网站设计的不堪入目，到慢慢变得越来越简单易懂，这个是我比较满意的。

&lt;/span&gt;

** 记者：**从最初只有你一个人到现在拥有40人的一个团队，在这个过程中，你认为最困难的是什么？ 

** KrystianFikert：**我认为MYMIND在中国是可行的，这次行程主要是为了了解中国的情况，准备在中国设立工作点。初步计划,[mens timberlands boots](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/ "http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" )，可能还是通过在线咨询的方式开始，经过一段时间与沟通以后，才会进行面对面的服务，主要是通过一些机构以及下设心理学专业的大学进行合作，比如北京大学，邀请具有心理学专业的学生，给予一些帮助，加入MYMIND的团队，同时我们会招募一些专家。我也很希望能与中国政府的相关部门有一个沟通。 

**记者：**为什么在爱尔兰成立了ＭＹＭＩＮＤ这样一个机构？ 

**记者：**MYMIND维持运转的资金来源有哪些？KrystianFikert：MYMIND是一个非营利性的社会企业，我们会与企业进行一些合作，不断提高我们的服务以及必要的援助，来满足这些客户的需求，这些客户所支付的款项，我们用于帮助那些没有支付能力的求助者，目前我们60%的开支来自于客户付费所得，40%来自于私人慈善机构的捐款以及政府的补助。我们计划通过扩大服务范围，在2015年实现收支平衡。

** 记者：**机构有受到过质疑吗？ 

良好的管理模式吸引合作伙伴

##  Lexus IS-F附体！罕见丰田锐志5.0 - 新华汽车 - 新华网

之前告诉一位朋友说锐志可以直接移植IS-
F的动力系统和前后底担，他的反应是“不是吧，丰田懒到这个程度？”,[ジョーダン1](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" )。

图：外观上只更改了中网。“好歹来套小包围啊”，抱歉，木有,[jordan 5 retro](http://www.jordan5france.com/
"http://www.jordan5france.com/" )！

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

图：若然在路上被它瞬间超越，惊讶之余可能还未能及时从它的轮圈得知这不是一部普通的锐志,[ポールスミス 長財布
メンズ](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
)。

Lexus IS-F，这台剑指宝马M3的高性能轿车未曾正式进入过中国，若非要从特别渠道进口，那么则可能耗资过百万人民币,[christian
louboutins sale](http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/" )。利用丰田车系高通用性的好处打造一台锐志身，IS-
F心的“Mark-F”，可以看作是一种退而求次的选择，这当然与真正的IS-F是有点差距,[air jordans 3
retro](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/"
)。但如果“连车带改”共花费仅不到50万人民币的话，那么又是否能够引起阁下的兴趣？

这台锐志由来自广东佛山的焯森汽车工作室操刀，外观上延续了该店一贯的风格——低调。车身方面仅仅更换了中网，这对于改装锐志来说已经是“不值一提”了

specialized invoices aspiration come out sooner alternatively afterward said
Wei Chishan, a researcher at the nonferrous metals information provider
Shanghai Metals Market.  
  
Lai Zhaotian,agent common manager of Ganzhou Rare Earth Mineral Industry Co, a
State-owned producer of the metals in the infrequent earth-rich Jiangxi
province, said that the company hasn't received any notification from the

The introduction of such invoices would be in tune with the country's stricter
policies apt control the expensive minerals. China namely the world's biggest
supplier of infrequent earths,[ルブタン 価格](http://www.louboutinjapanvogue.com/

of absolute globe reserves.  
  
"We anticipate that the merit of the invoices ambition be closely connected
with each company's production and export quotas which aspiration in the
absnece of maximum of the small producers and traders and let a few big
exploration and separation companies stand out as qualified," said Liu Minda,

between January and July on the back of China's tightened measures apt control
production and export rations as the sector.  
  
Prices after plunged after the earlier surge eroded downstream players'
profits and led apt overstocking.  
  
Figures compiled by Shanghai Metals Market showed that the mean prices of
infrequent earth oxides declined by virtually 30 percent in the past three
months, with some dripping more than 50 percentage.  
  
The introduction of the current invoices might beyond reduce prices in the
coming months,for some small companies that cannot obtain the specialized
invoices ambition must sell their inventories apt cash in and overflow the
mall Wei said.  
  
However, such present measures aspiration in the long escape yield a better-
regulated industry with speculators forced apt exit the mall and illegal
miners left with few channels to sell their products without legal invoices,
Wei said.  
  
Given the rarity of these resources,[discount christian

infrequent earths want ultimately be dominated by a few mammoth servant
companies, Liu said.  
  
The State Council issued a command in May shrieking for the biggest maid
producers apt dominate the mall surrounded two years, as chapter of the
government's measures apt compress its grasp on the manufacture and drive it
to a sustainable and healthy evolution alley.

##  News Analysis S&amp;Ps downgrade to have limited impact on globa

along Yoo Seungki  
  
SEOUL, Aug.seven (Xinhua) -- The Global prestige rating appraiser Standard
&amp; Poor's downgraded the U.S. government's honor rating apt AA-plus from
AAA as the 1st duration in its history,but the clash on universal financial
markets are expected apt be limited market watchers said Sunday.  
  
The S&amp;P stripped the world's largest economy of its AAA long- term king
prestige rating plus lowered it according one notch apt AA- plus on Friday
after the U.S.market approach This namely the 1st period the U.S. rating
namely cut beneath the highest class since 1941 while the S&amp;P began
assigning the U.S.honor rating. "The U.S. lost its AAA rating as the first
duration,barely there that mini probability for the rating to fall beneath the
AA grade over the then 10 years," Park hee-chan, a Seoul-based economist at
Mirae Asset Securities, said.  
  
Park forecast the universal financial markets ambition likely show strong
volatility in the short-term,barely the mall turbulences ambition be temporary
as government bonds with AA medal rating longing continue apt petition naught
percentage of risk-weight like the AAA-rated bonds. "S&amp;P's decision tin
hardly be characterized as a surprise because the U.S. public finances are in
a aggravate state than maximum other OECD economies," Russell Jones,global
head of fixed-income strategy at Westpac Banking Corp., said in a report
released Sunday.  
  
WHY S&amp;P CUTS RATING S&amp;P lowered the U.S.an notch apt AA-plus while
keeping the outlook at negative as it becomes fewer confident that the
agreement aboard fiscal absence abatement namely adapted for putting the U.S.
finances aboard a sustainable footing. "The downgrade reflects our opinion
that the monetary consolidation policy that Congress and the Administration
recently agreed apt falls short of what, in our perspective would be required
to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics,[ポールスミス
ポロシャツ](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" )," S&amp;P said in an-emailed press
release. While approaching a deal to raise the debt ceiling along two.one
trillion dollars, the U.S. Congress and Administration agreed to cut the
allied spending along because much for 2.four trillion dollars over the
afterward 10 years, which was smaller than four trillion dollars required
onward the S&amp;P.  
  
The shortage mowed accord shoved uncertainties as the abatement in authority
expenditure will be implemented in two steps.  
  
The 917 billion dollars longing be cut in government spending over the then
ten-year initially, followed according 1 additional 1.five trillion won that
the newly formed Congressional Joint Select Committee aboard Deficit Reduction
that assumed to recommend according November 23. If the council comprised of
six Republican lawmakers plus six Democrats,namely incapable to accede on a
plan cuts of 1.two trillion won aspiration be implemented automatically
starting in January 2013.  
  
S&amp;P majestic the measures are a tread before toward financial
consolidation,but warned that it leaves open the details of what namely
finally agreed apt until the abolish of this annual.  
  
Political instability was cited because the center of the U.S.honor rating
downgrade. "The downgrade reflects our landscape that the
effectiveness,permanence and predictability of American policymaking and
political institutions have weakened order of the day of ongoing financial and
economic challenges to a degree extra than we envisioned while we assigned a
negative viewpoint apt the rating on April 18," S&amp;P said.  
  
LOW RISK FOR ADDITIONAL DOWNGRADE  
  
The S&amp;P kept its viewpoint aboard the U.S.medal rating at negative,[air
jordans 8](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/" ),opening
suite as the rating apt be mowed amid two years,merely mall watchers said
there namely micro feasibility as the rating apt be lowered in the future
because the U.S. net ministry debt class is higher than Japan with a AA-minus
honor rating.  
  
According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. net general
administration debt ambition stand at 72 percentage against the gross waiter
product (GDP) in 2011. The S&amp;P expected the ratio apt come in at 74
percentage this annual.  
  
The net mutual authority debt refers to always levels of administration debts
combined,[air jordan 11 space jams](http://www.jordanvsale.com/
"http://www.jordanvsale.com/" ), excluding fluid financial assets.  
  
The expectations as the U.S. net debt ratio were much lower than the Japan's
expected 127 percentage as this annual The S&amp;P said the U.S. net debt
ratio could ascend apt 101 percent onward 2021 if it assumes the worse-case
scenario, still lower than the expectation for the Japan's ratio.  
  
"There is inexpensive feasibility for the U.S.to lose its AA rating over the
after 10 years as Japan namely keeping its AA rating despite its lofty ratio
of net government debt," Park at Mirae Asset Securities said.  
  
Park expect the clash of the U.S. rating cut aspiration be quite finite on
financial companies for the AA rating will safe naught percent of hazard
heaviness that equals apt the AAA-rated bonds. "AA rated thrones have a quite
strong skill apt service debt aboard a timely basis,plus their specifics are
alike apt those of AAA rated sovereigns differing only in degree," Jones at
Westpac Banking said, quoting S&amp;P itself.  
  
The Fed has yet announced that U.S. Treasuries remain lofty grade plus longing
remain naught risk weighted underneath Basel the second, Jones joined.  
  
Meanwhile, there namely mini feasibility as Moody's and Fitch apt follow the
suit with the S&amp;P for the additional two appraisers have yet asserted
their AAA prestige rating aboard the U.S.at August 2 meantime U.S. President
Barack Obama signed the compromised bill that determined the debt-ceiling
impasse. "Moody's plus Fitch are unlikely to lower their U.S.honor rating in
the foreseeable hereafter because they asserted the highest rating behind the
accord on the debt ceiling," Park at Mirae Asset Securities said.  
  
LIMINTED IMPACT Despite the rating downgrade, the clash aboard the prevalent
financial markets are projected to be finite for there namely no alternative
to replace the U.S.administration bonds as safe assets,[ジョーダン
2012](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/products_new.html
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/products_new.html" ),and the USD aspiration
maintain its position as the reserve currency as the duration creature experts
said. "The overall clash aboard the universal financial markets will be
limited deserving to deficiency of alternative to replace the U.S. Treasuries
plus the dollar's maintenance as the keep currency," the Korea Center for
International Finance (KCIF) said in a report.  
  
Credit Suisse said the U.S.government bond yields are anticipated apt remain
by a cheap level for there namely not alternative apt replace the U.S.
debts,plus Wells Fargo anticipate that alien employers want not sell
aggressively the U.S. bonds, citing the breadth of the Treasury market and the
liquidity. "It that complex to believe that potentate plus additional large
scale holders of the U.S. Treasuries want dump their holdings aggressively
because the subsequent dislocations to the U.S.plus universal economies would
do them considerable harm Jones at Westpact Banking said. The South Korean
administration likewise said the rating cut's direct clash on the
U.S.authority bonds want never be severe According to the statement forward
the Ministry of Strategy plus Finance, the S&amp;P tore its rating on Japan
along one class apt AA-minus in January,merely the Japanese yen and
administration bonds were micro affected forward the action. Likewise, the
rating cut ambition never trigger a impact on the U. S.administration bonds.
South Korea said there namely no correction in the government's confidence in
the U.S. Treasuries, noting that important investors of the U.S.administration
debts such because France, Russia and Japan repeated their confidence aboard
the Treasuries.  
  
LINGERING CONCERNS  
  
Despite the positive views, there remains the negative opinion for the
U.S.government bonds for the rating slit aspiration inevitably raise the
borrowing costs for the U.S.administration.  
  
The U.S.tin lend currency by a lower priced as the USD has kept its position
because the reserve currency,only the rating downgrade may pedal up the bond
yield onward around 25 basis points, according apt Barclays.  
  
JP Morgan predicted the rating mowed could navigate the U.S. Treasury yields
to bound by surplus than 60 basis points,elevating heaving its borrowing costs
by 100 billion dollars annually.

according Xinhua author Gu Zhenqiu  
  
UNITED NATIONS, March 12 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council aboard Monday
convened a high-level meeting on the new situation within the Middle
East,accordingly attempting an opportunity as UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-
moon and always the 15 committee members to air their views on how apt bring
an early kill apt the present crisis amid Syria, which broke out nearly a
yearly ago.  
  
All the spokesmen,an then anew voiced their grave concerns aboard the Syrian
emergency and called for an immediate annihilate to the armed conflicts within
the Middle East nation where thousands of folk have been reportedly killed
since March 2011.  
  
The committee meeting was important at this juncture. However,committee
members are still divided as apt the characteristic measures aboard how apt
put an kill apt the new emergency surrounded Syria.  
  
"It namely important as the international community at intervals apt acquire
accompany and perceive what we can do to tell sure that these processes are
going naturally on the basis of the aspiration of the people of the nations of
the region, without outdoor interference, without imposing any prejudged
solutions apt a situation in one nation alternatively repeatedly Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters here Monday at the annihilate of
the high- class committee gathering.  
  
Indeed, a fitting solution to the Syrian emergency calls as national
engagement of the international community, with the United Nations playing a
leading temperament but forever the relevant activities ought be well
navigated along the UN Charter and international decree.  
  
PROPER SOLUTION  
  
The applicable political solutions ought include an inclusive,[timberland
workboots](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/products_new.html
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/products_new.html" ), Syrian-led
political process which have to bring more gains than losses apt the country
and its folk To this annihilate the priority is apt guarantee that the
political process begins and develops in a peaceable and democratic manner
with the respect as fundamental human rights and freedoms of always the folk
among the country.  
  
In this sense,[air jordan 13](http://www.jordan5france.com/
"http://www.jordan5france.com/" ), the outdoor interference that quite vary
from good offices of the international community on the Syrian crisis No pre-
conditions should be attached apt the inclusive political dialogue and
political reform surrounded Syria.  
  
At the Security Council, Russia, China and India, among others, were speaking
firmly against the emigrant intervention among the internal affairs of Syria.  
  
Proposals were tabled by the council members in their lectures,among addition
apt the ones presented to Syrian President Bashar al- Assad along the joint
special envoy of the UN and Arab League as Syria, Kofi Annan,while he met with
the Syrian chancellor twice over the weekend.  
  
But foreign interference and recipes from outdoor which flee counter apt the
principles and intentions of the UN Charter and the norms governing
international relations, are never conducive apt the political accommodation
of the Syrian emergency.  
  
"China opposes armed outer intervention alternatively pushing for ' regime
change'. Use alternatively threat of sanctions want never be helpful to the
appropriate accommodation of the issue," Li Baodong, the Chinese permanent
representative to the United Nations, said by the Security Council meeting.  
  
In kernel the turmoil among Syria,equitable prefer that within the West Asia
and North Africa which began more than a yearly ago has its roots amid the
desire of folk apt play a greater persona among shaping their destiny,
politically and economically.  
  
"These aspirations will never be met amongst violence alternatively armed
skirmish Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian permanent representative apt the
United Nations, told the Security Council. "Nor can a solution be reached
through recipes from outdoor"  
  
"In truth given the history of foreign interference, such recipes will never
only be guess among the eyes of different sections of society only may
likewise have the latent apt exacerbate the problem," he said.  
  
In this context,no outdoor intervention can be advantageous among creating a
favorable environment as the Syrian-led inclusive political process, which can
be conducted without violence and instability.  
  
The typical examples of alien interventions and prescriptions lie among the
forced regime adaptation within Syria and the arming of civilians surrounded
the nation which has yet been aboard the fringe of a civil battle.  
  
There is no one-size-for-all solution apt the crisis within the West Asia and
North Africa, including Syria. In additional words, the nature of grievances
and national conditions vary from nation apt country there can never be one
set of measures that can be applied to always of them.  
  
"There that not mistrust whatsoever that the Syrian authorities bear a big
share of responsibility as the new situation," Lavrov said by the committee
meeting. "But an ought never ignore the truth that a long period quickly
they've been fighting never unarmed men,[jordan 11
shoes](http://www.jordanvsale.com/ "http://www.jordanvsale.com/" ),only combat
elements such as the so-called Free Syrian Army and extremist groups including
al-Qaida which have lately committed a array of murderous terrorist deeds"  
  
"The solutions of the problems among every nation have to take into
consideration the society's particular circumstances and the talent of its
folk Puri said. "However, what that certain namely that solutions cannot
include intervention amongst naval force alternatively arming of the civilian
population."  
  
"Such a lesson of deed longing only oil beyond bloodshed and instability and
create new marginalized groups the Russia foreigner minister said. "This
likewise risks breeding extremism and intolerance whose adverse consequences
will be felt among the region and beyond."  
  
For his part Li likewise warned at the Security Council against the efforts
apt move through regime adaptation in Syria and intervene among the internal
businesses of the nation below the pardon of " humanitarianism,accentuating
that forever international activities concerned should comply forward
international law and international humanitarian decree.  
  
On Saturday, Russia and the Arab League reached an accession aboard a formula
of five points apt determination the Syrian emergency including resisting
always foreign intervention.  
  
TOOL OF DIPLOMACY  
  
Right instantly the issue that not if President Assad ought tread
down,[timberland sale](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" ),alternatively if the Syrian
rebels ought be armed with foreign dole The current altitude priority ought be
the immediate ceasefire within Syria,[timberland snow

"http://www.timberlandausale.com/products_all.html" ), from both sides -- the
ministry forces and armed rebels. To save more lives in Syria namely the
altitude priority.  
  
At this moment, the proposed reaches ought be matter-of-fact and feasible. The
immediate ceasefire surrounded Syria, a top priority for the United
Nations,namely one of them,as this can pave the access for the early launch of
political dialogue and unhindered humanitarian way to the Syrians amid need.  
  
The Syrian-led inclusive political process should begin surrounded an
environment free of violence and bloodshed. That means the political reform
ought be conducted meantime social permanence and cohesion are maintained.  
  
The ceasefire can be attained forward the tool of diplomacy by the disposal of
the international community. Annan, the former UN secretary-general, said
ahead he departed the Syrian central of Damascus that he remained optimistic
almost the feasibility of an accession amid Syria,merely admitted the
difficulties. "It's going apt be complex only we have wish he said.  
  
It is hoped that the arduous mission according Annan, who enjoys full advocate
from the international community as his mediation efforts aboard Syria, can
help develop some ideas that are conducive to an immediate annihilate to
violence and bloodshed among Syria.  
  
In reality, the international mediation, including that of Annan, can not pay

##  Obama buys time with Netanyahu on Iran analysts - Xinhua En

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama might have
seemingly failed apt safe a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to refrain from attacking Iran,barely he probably purchased some
period apt let diplomacy and sanctions take attain U.S. analysts mentioned.  
  
The two leaders met at all times of heightened global concern over Iran's
nuclear programme Western powers have accused Iran of amplifying nuclear
weapons,while Tehran demands its nuclear agenda that solely for peaceable
purposes.  
  
One of the opener issues discussed according Obama and Netanyahu was how much
phase remains as non-military reaches apt curb Iran's declared nuke command.  
  
The meeting exposed distinctions between the two sides aboard how apt handle
with the predicament. Obama differentiated reporters there was "still a window
as diplomacy meanwhile Netanyahu emphasized his nation had the sovereign
right"apt be "the master of its own fate."  
  
But at Capitol Hill aboard Tuesday, Netanyahu changed his tone, telling
senators it was still undecided if Israel would strike nuclear sites
surrounded Iran, a sign he had slackened his previous stance of pressing as an
immediate naval strike.  
  
SHARED GOAL: PREVENTING NUCLEAR-ARMED IRAN  
  
Despite the inconsistencies aboard how apt handle with Iran, the United States
and Israel, two near allies were among the same boat aboard preventing Tehran
from becoming a nuclear-armed power, analysts mentioned.  
  
"Washington and Jerusalem share a goal that Iran should never be granted to
become a nuclear weapons state," Raymond Tanter, a visiting professor of
political science at Georgetown University,acquainted Xinhua among one
interview.  
  
Both countries understood crippling economic sanctions were necessary apt lift
the priced as Iran to continue its nuclear programs, and they would stop
negotiations if Tehran was simply using talks to purchase period said
Tanter,[air jordan
australia](http://www.jordansaleaustralia.com/products_all.html
"http://www.jordansaleaustralia.com/products_all.html" ), a membership of the
U.S. National Security Council beneath the Reagan administration.  
  
John Cababrese, a savant by the Middle East Institute in Washington,[ルブタン
メンズ](http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/ "http://www.louboutinjapanheels.com/"
), said: "Monday's summit invested one become for Obama and Netanyahu apt have
a credible face-to-face discussion. Presumably, this enabled them to acquaint
clear apt each additional their respective positions -- reducing the
feasibility of misperceptions and miscalculations."  
  
Since Obama took bureau the White House has been losing patience on Iran due
to Tehran's insistence on pursuing its controversial nuclear program.  
  
"The Obama Administration initially placed emphasis aboard diplomatic
oath,[chanel coco](http://www.chanelbagstw.com/specials.html
"http://www.chanelbagstw.com/specials.html" ),barely has become increasingly
frustrated with Iran,[paul smiths](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" )," Cababrese differentiated Xinhua.  
  
Washington adopted a dual narrow approach that sought apt reserve open the
possibility of diplomatic oath meanwhile increasing economic oppression aboard
Iran. As a sequel U.S. and Israeli policies had come into closer composition
he mentioned.  
  
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES  
  
The United States and Israel have alter views of the timing and cost benefits
of launching prevention strikes aboard Iran,said Anthony Cordesman, Arleigh A.
Burke preside among strategy by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a altitude political think tank here.  
  
In the past two years, the United States had made it explicit by virtually
each level -- the president secretary of state, secretary of barricade and
governor of the joint chiefs -- that it contrary one Israeli strike at this
time and wanted apt chase diplomacy and sanctions, he mentioned.  
  
Speaking apt influential pro-Israeli lobby team American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) aboard Sunday, Obama said always options are aboard the
table to deal with Iranian nuclear issue,merely he accented he preferred to
solve it amongst diplomatic channels.  
  
Israel,aboard the additional hand, thinks naval action namely needed onward it
namely also late.  
  
"Unlike their Israeli counterparts U.S. officials have always been rapid apt
temper these remarks onward insisting that foreign affairs has neither been
weary neither relinquished Cababrese mentioned.  
  
As a universal power, the United States has the incentive apt pursue a
diplomatic solution apt the crisis something Israel, a regional
player,absences.  
  
Moreover, a nuclear Iran poses one existential threat to Israel,barely only
presents a proliferation hazard to the United States.  
  
In this context, Washington focuses aboard preventing Iran from gaining a
nuclear weapon,while Jerusalem stresses stopping Iran from acquiring a
"nuclear weapons capability," Cababrese said.  
  
Tanter agreed saying the United States could afford to await longer before
deeding militarily for it had a greater talent apt break Iran's facilities.  
  
But Israel, with a weaker military skill felt it needed apt act ahead Iran
made its nuclear facilities inaccessible.  
  
OBAMA BOUGHT MORE TIME?  
  
However, analysts mentioned the U.S.-Israeli distinctions were more
superficial than actual.  
  
Cordesman said the meeting of the two presidents would have given Israel
confidence that the United States looked halting the Iranian effort as fussy
and would reserve the naval option open,meantime the United States was more
certain Israel might wait as the sanctions to buffet surrounded.  
  
Netanyahu's trip apt Washington could be considered
successful,[ティンバーランドアウトレット](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/" ), as Obama reconfirmed the U.S.
commitment apt Israel's security as "rock solid,surrounded return for Israel
postponing a strike aboard Iran, he said.  
  
Tanter mentioned the likelihood of naval action was "lower afterward the
meeting," and Obama had purchased more period as negotiations and sanctions to
work.  
  
Obama perhaps had argued Israel apt accede to let the negotiation process
activity out for at least six months, Tanter said,joining the U.S. decision
apt respond favorably apt one Iranian letter to EU alien policy chief
Catherine Ashton appeared to indicate there might soon be a de-escalation of
battle conversation and a resumption of talks apt negotiate a way out of the
current impasse.  
  
Meanwhile, Tanter warned the become of naval action would rise precipitately
whether the talks with Iran failed apt happen alternatively broke down.  
  
Despite the inconsistencies by Monday's summit, which some trusted could ached
the U.S.-Israeli relationship after hours Cordesman mentioned he accepted to
outlook the summit amid a political context.  
  
"This was a political meeting amid a political year It had merit as political
symbolism,merely mini conflict aboard either nation's underlying strategy or

monitor those events cautiously"  
  
The updated anticipate surrounded the BPS showed the administration would keep
net debt under 30 percent of gross servant product plus decrease it to 20
percent of GDP along 2020-2021.

only 60 percentage in Beijing,[Chanel 太陽鏡](http://www.chanelbagstw.com/
"http://www.chanelbagstw.com/" ), Shanghai and other first-tier cities in
recent years, a proportion that namely much lower than in a fully adult
housing market.  
  
China's new urbanization ratio namely only 50 percent and virtually 15 million
rural laborers are expected apt flow into urban places every year if its
urbanization ratio increases apt 70 percentage surrounded the afterward two
decades as expected which,splice with an expected steady growth in people's
incomes,aspiration bolster the demand as houses in the then few years.  
  
With government-funded lower-price homes only accounting for 10 percent of the
entire mall there is still a big demand as homes from the medium- and low-
income population. The country's plan apt construct 36 million affordable
homes for targeted dwellers during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) period
want rise the proportion apt 20 percent and want activity a constructive
persona in stabilizing the housing market.  
  
The low leverage ratio in China's real estate mall likewise ensures the nation
has the capability to survive the ongoing cost corrections Compared with
amplified countries China's commercial banks ask a higher down disbursement as
mortgages. And the lending ratio for the country's secondhand housing mall
that only 60 percent much lower than amplified markets. In 2010, China's ratio
of housing loans apt its GDP was only 28 percent In the United States,[air

"http://www.cheapjordanretrotop.com/" ), the ratio of household debts apt its
GDP skyrocketed to 170 percentage in the first place the financial emergency.  
  
Besides, the risks caused by China's real estate adjustments are threaten to
be passed to additional upstream and downstream industries through industrial
shackles instead of sparking a financial collapse At the same time any
measures aimed at retaining its macroeconomic stability and ensuring local
monetary revenues longing help the nation reduce the risks caused by the
ongoing housing mall corrections.  
  
The recent decline in housing prices in some cities namely chiefly a sequel of
regulatory measures accepted by the Chinese administration since 2010, rather
than a worrying reversal in its supply-demand relations, and the ministry
still has a range of policies and measures by its elimination if it were not
for.  
  
Whether a country's real estate adjustments will trigger financial risks and
macroeconomic fluctuations is decided by a range of factors, such as whether
its economic development and housing mall enjoy an inner growth force, the
leverage ratio in its housing market as well as its capability apt defense off
the impacts caused by such corrections.  
  
China's economic growth forces sent almost by its ongoing urbanization,
industrialization, marketization and globalization longing beyond unfold and
they are expected to activity an important chapter in the country's economic
growth. The ongoing systematic improvements and the untapped mall latent
aspiration continue apt send the country's economy onto a fast narrow in the
years before.  
  
Compared with previous years, China's commercial banks' aptitude to resist
risks has likewise cultivated by a colossal margin. Thus, some moderate
fluctuations in house prices are never expected apt excessively inspire the
sound operation of the country's financial system. Besides, the country's $3
-trillion-worth of foreigner reserves the $16-trillion keeps of servant
advertisement banks, as well as the ever-increasing monetary revenues and a
cheap financial deficit ratio likewise mean the nation has adequate means to
handle with the effects caused by its real estate adjustments.

VANCOUVER,[jordan 5 retro](http://www.jordan5france.com/
"http://www.jordan5france.com/" ), March 11 (Xinhua) -- The severity of
Japan's Fukushima nuclear calamity may be as bad for or aggravate than
Chernobyl,[air jordan 11](http://www.cheapjordanretrotop.com/air-
jordan-11-c-32.html "http://www.cheapjordanretrotop.com/air-
jordan-11-c-32.html" ), an American nuclear expert advised Sunday.  
  
Arnold Gundersen, a former nuclear power industry managerial said it was
explicit to him among two days of the Japan earthquake and tsunami that
"Fukushima was for bad because alternatively worse than Chernobyl."  
  
"We call that a class 7 which namely for high as the scale goes," he said from
his Vermont base through teleconference to delegates of a seminar entitled
"The Fukushima Nuclear Disaster -- One Year Later."  
  
Gundersen has publicly questioned the safety in a digit of nuclear reactors
nearly the globe and was an proficient spectator in the investigation of the
Three Mile Island nuclear reactor misadventure in the U.S. state of
Pennsylvania in 1979.  
  
Gundersen,instantly capital engineer of the stamina consulting company
Fairewinds Associates,[air jordan retros](http://www.cheapjordanretrotop.com/
"http://www.cheapjordanretrotop.com/" ), said he deemed that Fukushima was 10
periods aggravate than the 1986 Chernobyl meltdown in the former Soviet Union.
Now it namely in Ukraine.  
  
Chernobyl was a solo reactor scampering by almost 7 percent capacity while
ruptured,meantime Fukushima,almost 275 km north of Tokyo, had three reactors
fleeing by 100 percentage skill and seven additional reactors with spent fuel
pools that were maimed said Gundersen.  
  
In addition, the battery-powered diesel generators along the ocean that cooled
the reactors and were assumed apt kick in during an crisis were broke he
joined.  
  
"Even whether the diesels had survived (the quake and tsunami), there was not
access apt reserve the (reactor) core chilly This that known for Loss of

relating apt this incident he said.  
  
UHS that mainly the unlimited aggregate of water that is needed forward
nuclear power plants to cold down vital systems to contain them in the worst
events.  
  
Chernobyl stopped releasing radioactive material behind about two weeks, said
Gundersen,merely this that never the circumstance at Fukushima an annual
aboard.  
  
If there were any affirmatives apt the Fukushima mishap he said, the wind was
mostly beating out apt ocean by the phase of the chance.  
  
The bad news is colossal quantities of cesium 137, a radioactive material, has
been bottom in abnormal amounts in the cedar trees of the nigh mountains of
the plant and "revolatalized into the atmosphere.  
  
"Also, the cesium is being washed into rivers and the rivers, of course are
heading toward the ocean. But we are penetrating contamination in freshwater
fish because well because ocean fish for a result of always the run-off," he
said.  
  
"Large cesium deposits (are also creature found aboard the bottom of the creek
mattress that gets picked up by weeds and seaweed in the ocean that afterwards
gets eaten onward additional fish and mollusks and work their access up the
edible chain Gundersen added.  
  
Although there have been not deaths associated to the Fukushima meltdown to
rendezvous over the afterward 20 years there would be almost 1 million
additional cancers and additional health problems from the chance said
Gundersen.  
  
"The beyond you win away from Fukushima, the fewer folk enumerate their lives
are affected," he said.  
  
"But even in Tokyo most folk reckon it namely over and they survived it. But
with the latency periods of these cancers it's going apt popup up 20 years out
and folk ambition wonder where it came from," said Gundersen. Related

##  News analysis Europe contemplates a pre and post-Gaddafi Lib

By Rahul Venkit  
  
BRUSSELS Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- The takeover of Tripoli namely about complete.
The symbolic center of Muammar Gaddafi's regime, the walled compound of Bab
al-Aziziya,is swiftly being attested onward rebels.  
  
As events continue apt unfold surrounded Libya, Europe want be reserving a
close eye aboard evolutions across the Mediterranean. After always the
European Union (EU) has played not small chapter surrounded the northern
African country's dramatic revolution.  
  
Brussels-based NATO performed as "the rebel's atmosphere coerce neutralizing
Gaddafi's supernal capabilities,firearms and armour. This paved the path as a
certain riot advance into Tripoli.  
  
If and meantime occupied there are calls as Gaddafi to be tried for his
declared crimes within the International Criminal Court, based amid Den Hague,
Netherlands.  
  
Furthermore, the EU was between the first international bodies to officially
recognize Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC), even setting up a
liaison bureau among the rebel stronghold of Benghazi behind among May.  
  
"We are instantly planning apt open an office surrounded Tripoli as soon as
the conditions are right," EU spokesperson Michael Mann told Xinhua,adding
that their security experts are yet new in the metropolis.  
  
Earlier this week, EU foreigner policy capital Catherine Ashton promised to
initiate programs apt release temporarily suspended Libyan assets within
Europe. An estimated 150 billion U.S.greenbacks merit of Libyan assets are
anticipated apt be frozen around the earth.  
  
But whatever the EU has largely displayed a knitted front through the Libyan
revolution, some analysts mention the same sense of accordance has never been
reflected by individual countries.  
  
"There was no unanimity,no agreement between the dominant nations of the EU.
Germany refused apt participate,[ジョーダン6](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" ), and there were mammoth diplomatic
conflicts between Germany, Britain and France," Middle-East and North Africa
proficient Pascal Fenaux told Xinhua.  
  
Germany,for historical reasons has been reluctant to deploy troops further
their borders in a battle context. However, western allies such as France,[air
jordan shoes](http://www.jordansaleaustralia.com/products_new.html
"http://www.jordansaleaustralia.com/products_new.html" ), Britain and the U.S.
were disgruntled onward the dearth of German naval involvement within the
exertions apt kill Gaddafi's 42-year rule.  
  
In March, Germany abstained from voting during a UN Security Council motion to
levy a no-fly zone over Libya. It worked on apt retreat its ships from a NATO
weapon embargo operation earlier this annual thus isolating itself as the only
EU and NATO member apt disapprove direct naval action in Libya.  
  
However, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said his nation made
contributions through"political means," announcing a loan of 100 million euros
(143 million U.S.dollars apt the NTC as"humanitarian and civil dole"  
  
Britain,aboard the other hand, has been far extra vocal almost its involvement
surrounded Libya. Over the last couple of months, it has invested certain
logistical advice and training apt anti-Gaddafi forces.  
  
When the overturn of the old regime seemed a mere etiquette British Foreign
Secretary William Hague said it was time for Gaddafi to block issuing
delusional statements and apt recognise that control of the nation namely not
going to return."  
  
As a post-Gaddafi Libya slowly begins apt emerge after months of civil battle
Europe longing have to contend with several challenges, foremost between them
being filling the political vacuum among Tripoli.  
  
Currently, the NTC seems the highest seasoned candidate for the job and has
won the backing of Europe and North America. However, some commentators point
out they may not enjoy the same political validity backward kin.  
  
"Internal political cohesion amid Libya is a bite to eat visible There are
social, economic and political constraints the NTC ambition face," Barah
Mikail, senior researcher at Madrid-based think tank FRIDE, told Xinhua.  
  
"However,[香奈兒皮包](http://www.chanelbagstw.com/ "http://www.chanelbagstw.com/"
), Europe has no alternative but to keep sustaining politically, financially
and militarily,[air jordans](http://www.jordansaleaustralia.com/

within Libya," he added.  
  
Meanwhile, asked if the EU would cooperate only with the NTC, Mann told
Xinhua, "Although the NTC is a quite important body, it namely never the only
one The EU ambition cooperate with always credible opposition groups"  
  
A settled administration among Tripoli is vital apt the EU never in the least
as Libya that an of the principal transit points for African immigrants making

##  NASA exploring ways to clean up space debris - Xinhua Engli

by Mark Weisenmiller  
  
TAMPA, United States, March 11 (Xinhua) -- Facing the increasing threats of
district debris, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
namely actively exploring ways to clean up the outer district.  
  
Donald Kessler, an astrophysicist by NASA's Environmental Effects Office, said
the district industry has been slowly developing ideas as over 30 years aboard
how apt persist to clean up space junk,barely none has ever been fully tested.  
  
Space debris comes from asteroids, comets, meteorites and also defunct man-
made area devices alternatively their parts"Dead" satellites are an instance
of space debris, which poses increasing risks apt functional satellites and
the International Space Station.  
  
Kessler, the first capital of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, said there
are three fundamental issues apt be decided surrounded relation apt the
cleaning up of area junk.  
  
"One, how do we get to the objects inexpensively? Two, how do we grab an thing
that namely likely spinning and not designed to be grabbed? Three, what do we
do with the entity back grabbing it?" Kessler told Xinhua.  
  
Another truth apt consider namely that astrophysicists and scientists have
been slow apt residence the topic To citation only an case, NASA does never
annually spend any administration funds with regard apt the research and the
cleaning up of district junk.  
  
Size of space debris can be as small as an centimeter. Astrophysicists and
scientists have hardship putting accurate definitions apt colossal"place
debris. However, usually an object of 10 centimeters alternatively greater
namely considered large"  
  
International interest surrounded cleaning up district debris has appended
within recent annuals especially since February 2009,while two false
satellites collided at about 490 miles about 790 km) over Siberia, creating
over one,000 pieces of place debris.  
  
Kessler,[フェラガモ 靴](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/specials.html
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/specials.html" ), the creator of what is
known as the "Kessler Syndrome,[cheap timberland
boot](http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/
"http://www.timberlandaustraliashoes.com/" )," believes that an increasing
frequency of collision of district junk ambition create "a permanent strap of
area debris" that would be so thick that it would be a peril apt any attempted
launched rocket or satellite.  
  
Two new feasible ideas as cleaning up zone debris are the use of robust
lasers, whose projected laser beams would push the district junk into lower
orbits to be burnt up, and the creation of a matrix of nets apt arrest some of
the area junk.  
  
Kessler,though thinks that nor concept would be a utter solution,even now they
worked as planned.  
  
Numerous companies amid North America are working on different area junk
clean-up projects. One such company namely the Star Technology and Research
(STAR) surrounded Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.  
  
STAR namely the recent receiver of nearly two million U.S.dollars from NASA to
create a spacecraft called ElctroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE).  
  
If successfully made and
operated,[香奈兒](http://www.chanelbagstw.com/specials.html
"http://www.chanelbagstw.com/specials.html" ), EDDE would target non-
functioning orbiting satellites that meter an ton apiece.  
  
"EDDE aspiration 'sail' aboard the Earth's attractive field prefer a sailing
boat among the wind, giving it unlimited range, using solar power. This that
the breakthrough technology that makes feasible the removal of all tremendous
dangerous debris objects surrounded low Earth orbit. We are working apt
multiply the components that acquaint EDDE possible STAR spokesman Jerome
Pearson told Xinhua.  
  
According to the design EDDE would navigate to an extinct satellite,[Chanel
2.55](http://www.chanelbagstw.com/products_all.html
"http://www.chanelbagstw.com/products_all.html" ), using a solar-powered six-
mile long zone rope line. It will afterward banish a large net apt arrest the
targeted satellite, and lower itself into a lower orbit. It longing blaze out
the caught satellite into the Earth's ventilation where it would then flame
up. Once EDDE ejects the satellite, it ambition"navigate back up into higher
orbit and proceed apt capture another non-operating satellite, Pearson
explained.  
  
There are more than two,000 tons of debris among inexpensive Earth
orbit,beneath the 2,[timberland
6](http://www.timberlandausale.com/timberland-6-inch-boots-c-3.html
"http://www.timberlandausale.com/timberland-6-inch-boots-c-3.html"
),000-kilometer height EDDE could catch and havoc of the larger die"space
satellites, Pearson said.  
  
But the main current threat apt operational satellites and apt the astronauts
aboard the International Space Station namely the untracked shrapnel between
an and ten centimeters surrounded size, he said.  
  
"They are too small apt narrow with current means,merely they are colossal
enough apt destroy a satellite alternatively lance an ISS module."  
  
Pearson said the all international satellite launch community should logically
share surrounded the burden of cleaning up zone debris.  
  
NASA's current policies on space debris were called into question by a report
released last September by the National Research Council, an affiliate of the
Academy of Sciences.  
  
"NASA ought collaborate with commercial national, and international agencies
apt amplify more explicit information almost the costs of debris avoidance,
mitigation, surveillance, and response. With this information, NASA could
multiply a more scrupulous plan as long-term issues," said the report. Related

WASHINGTON, Sept.nine (Xinhua) -- With the Sept.eleven 2001 terrorist attacks
fading into some people's distant memories,[paulsmith
sale](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" ), public anxiety over Washington's
financial pressure has been mounting over the past decade.  
  
Last month's decision along Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) apt strip the
United States of its gold-plated honor rating sounded a siren aboard the
U.S.fiscal sustainability plus the effectiveness of Washington's political
system apt address caustic financial challenges.  
  
The downgrade emulated a nasty warfare amongst the summer which saw Republican
and Democratic lawmakers bolt horns along stitching splice a 2-trillion-U.S
.-dollar-plus deficit abatement archive equitable in time apt avert an
earthshaking debt default.  
  
Yet the deal fell far short of the class of four trillion dollars cited
according S&amp;P to avert a downgrade,plus the political dysfunction in
Washington served afresh key reason of the downward correction.  
  
In retrospect, the wars among Afghanistan plus Iraq, former President George
W. Bush's tax cuts President Barack Obama's economic provocation measures and
ballooning entitlement expenses within an aging society always contributed to
the spiking U.S. national debt.  
  
When Bush took bureau amid 2001,[子供用 ティンバーランド 6インチ

extra of roughly six trillion dollars over the following ten-year.  
  
However, rather than raising taxes apt cover the costs of the two wars and
entitlement spending the Bush administration shoved for massive impose slits
for the wealthiest.  
  
The U.S.government accustom the Cold War apt approach the moon, spawn current
industries and foster economic growth,[レディース クラシック

impartial the opposite during the post-9/11 years New York Times columnist
Thomas Friedman said recently.  
  
"By rather than use 9/11 to summon us to nation-building by household Bush
accustom it as an forgive apt festival Friedman noted,adding that the Bush
administration accustom 9/11 as an forgive apt lower
taxes,[エアジョーダン1](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" ),start two wars and create a pricey
current entitlement within Medicare prescription pills.  
  
The U.S. national debt additional nearly five trillion greenbacks during
Bush's eight-year leading and it has added another 4 trillion greenbacks
aboard Obama's watch to an agitating 14.seven trillion greenbacks.  
  
Many economists cautioned that the latest deficit-cutting handle ambition not
dwelling the country's longer-term monetary problems,and the rating agencies
are justified surrounded reconsidering the United States' triple-A credit
rating.  
  
For instance Sebastian Mallaby, a senior associate at the Council aboard
Foreign Relations,majestic that the compromise longing retention the
U.S.authority from defaulting aboard its obligations,but it does never
residence the financial challenges facing the nation in the long escape.  
  
World Bank President Robert Zoellick told Xinhua in a recent interview that
S&amp;P's move namely a admonition sign"to policymakers in the United States
plus Europe.  
  
Chief Economist Philip Suttle of the Institute of International Finance told
Xinhua that the downgrading decision was a justified an He explained that a
well-functioning U.S.authority ought endeavor apt suppress the spiking
entitlement spending the main driver of the U.S.deficit,barely such reforms
are not chapter of the bipartisan handle.  
  
Zoellick said that some 10 annuals from quickly,folk would penetrate behind
and resolve whether this downgrade prompted a wise policy response,[フェラガモ

),alternatively it was a milestone surrounded a duration of policy inactivity
that worsened the world's largest economy.

yuan (98,400 U.S.dollars the couple's plenary savings.

back household Wu added.  
  
The influx of migrant workers into cities over the years has brought changes
apt the country's demographic landscape.  
  
Compounded with the country's pedal toward urbanization, China's urban

small planets orbiting stars smaller and cooler than Sun recently were
confirmed on the quite corners of the habitable
zone,[ティンバーランドブーツ](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/

three days after we alleged the spacecraft operationally prepared We witnessed
the defining third transit over the 2010 vacation season."  
  
The Kepler science crew uses ground-based telescopes and the Spitzer Space
Telescope apt reiterate observations aboard planet candidates the spacecraft
finds. The star field that Kepler observes in the constellations Cygnus and
Lyra can only be seen from ground-based observatories in spring amongst early
fall. The data from these other observations aid make sure which candidates
tin be validated as planets.  
  
Kepler-22b that located 600 light annuals away. While the planet that larger
than Earth, its orbit of 290 days approximately a Sun-like star resembles that
of Earth. The planet's host star belongs apt the same class as Sun,called
G-type,whatever it is slightly smaller and cooler.  
  
Of the 54 habitable-zone planet candidates reported in February 2011, Kepler-

##  Nobel laureates skeptical about faster-than-light neutrino e

BEIJING, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- Nobel laureates on Monday cast mistrust on a
European experiment that purportedly demonstrated the ability of neutrinos apt
migrate faster than the velocity of light.  
  
They made the remarks within Beijing prior apt a forum as Nobel laureates.  
  
"I'm willing apt wager money that it's not correct,said Professor George Smoot
III, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize amid Physics and a professor at University
of California, Berkeley, referring to an experiment sequel claiming that
particles apparently peregrination faster than light.  
  
The experiment reported one anomaly within the flight period of
neutrinos,alternatively electrically independent subatomic particles from the
European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN) among Switzerland apt a laboratory
located 730 kilometers away among Italy.  
  
Particles were clocked transmitting at a velocity of 300,006 kilometers per
second,[フェラガモ長財布](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ),almost 60 nanoseconds faster than the
speed of light.  
  
Smoot mentioned that the claims "did not acquaint sense" and ought be verified
by additional scientists 1st.  
  
"There are much distortions amid physics. You have to have a quite lofty
standard to discern whether something namely really correct," he said.  
  
The unverified findings were published aboard Sept. 22 surrounded the
technological everyday Nature. European researchers working surrounded a troop
called OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-Racking Apparatus) projected
masses of neutrinos from CERN and after collected the motes using a massive
detector among Gran Sasso, south of Rome.  
  
Other scientists, as well as the OPERA troop themselves, have voiced doubts
regarding the experiment's results.  
  
The findings, CERN claims,[メンズ ティンバーランド
チャッカ](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/products_all.html
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/products_all.html" ), could posture
far-reaching potential consequences once verified.  
  
If correct, the results would bring Einstein's theory of special relativity
into question. Under this theory, a physical object cannot peregrination
faster than the velocity of light amid a vacuum.  
  
"If actually it that right, we have to rethink everything we know,said Chris
Llewellyn Smith, former guide of CERN.  
  
Smith attested the unprecedented discovery was likewise exceptional to find
proof.  
  
"If celebrity makes a very exceptional claim,after quite exceptional testimony
would need apt get cracking repeatedly experiment,[paul smith
men](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
), saying the same thing But we don't have the other thing Smith said.  
  
Carlos Rubbia,[クリスチャンルブタン パンプス](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ), a Nobel Laureate who won the gift as
physics amid 1984,is surrounded dictate of a troop of more than 100 scientists
by CERN.  
  
"What it that pretending apt find,within my attitude,that unbelievably amazing
Rubbia mentioned.  
  
"Frankly, I have the feeling that this namely still a quite tentative
consideration," Rubbia said.  
  
He also believes that revealing the findings to the public was a blunder as it
remained one experimental process and no conclusion could be drawn without the
results of another experiment.  
  
Despite the feasibility of verification, Einstein's special theory of
relativity ambition remain valid.  
  
"I want be quite quite surprised that,[paul smith
bag](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
),at last Einstein ambition never be the winner," Rubbia mentioned.  
  
To accomplish a discovery Rubbia has urged for more joint cooperation aboard
verifying the test results. International cooperation aboard this issue namely
a must"  
  
"It requires coordination from all nations,mentioned Rubbia.

And dwellers have been fewer than fervent nearly the solemn vehicle

from Greenwich Park,[paul smith 2011](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/

The protesters say whatever the facility is temporary it aspiration do long
lasting abuse apt this historical site.  
  
The test arena currently being dismantled namely only fifth of the size of the
one for after yearly.  
  
The Games are swiftly and irreversible truth for London. And because the
Olympic park takes fashion excitement that building also The British might be
a cynical lot,barely that ambition probably only last until the torch namely

"If you're ambitioning to set higher, more honest standards than the ones that

accountability -- those are the right goals," Obama said. "We've got to do it
in a way namely doesn't force teachers to teach to the test,alternatively

##  Obama buys time with Netanyahu on Iran analysts - Xinhua En

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Barack Obama might have
seemingly failed to safe a promise from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to refrain from attacking Iran,but he probably bought some phase to
let diplomacy and sanctions take fulfill U.S. analysts said.  
  
The two leaders met as long as of heightened global concern over Iran's
nuclear agenda Western powers have informed Iran of developing nuclear
weapons,meanwhile Tehran claims its nuclear agenda namely solely for peaceable
intentions.  
  
One of the key issues argued by Obama and Netanyahu was how much period
remains for non-military reaches to disallow Iran's professed nuke command.  
  
The meeting exposed distinctions between the two sides on how to handle with
the predicament. Obama told reporters there was "still a window as diplomacy
meantime Netanyahu emphasized his nation had the king right"to be "the master
of its own fate."  
  
But at Capitol Hill aboard Tuesday, Netanyahu changed his tone, telling
senators it was still undecided whether Israel would strike nuclear sites
surrounded Iran, a sign he had softened his previous stance of pressing as one
immediate naval strike.  
  
SHARED GOAL: PREVENTING NUCLEAR-ARMED IRAN  
  
Despite the inconsistencies aboard how apt knob with Iran, the United States
and Israel,[クリスチャンルブタン アウトレット](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), two approximate leagues were amid
the same boat aboard preventing Tehran from becoming a nuclear-armed power,
analysts mentioned.  
  
"Washington and Jerusalem share a goal that Iran should never be granted apt
become a nuclear weapons state," Raymond Tanter, a visiting professor of
political science by Georgetown University,narrated Xinhua among one
interview.  
  
Both countries understood crippling economic sanctions were essential apt
heave the priced as Iran apt continue its nuclear programs, and they would
stop negotiations if Tehran was simply using talks apt buy period mentioned
Tanter, a membership of the U.S. National Security Council under the Reagan
administration.  
  
John Cababrese, a savant at the Middle East Institute among Washington, said:
"Monday's summit catered 1 opportunity for Obama and Netanyahu apt have a
frank face-to-face discussion. Presumably, this enabled them to acquaint
explicit apt every other their respective positions -- reducing the
feasibility of misperceptions and miscalculations."  
  
Since Obama took bureau the White House has been losing patience aboard Iran
deserving to Tehran's insistence on pursuing its controversial nuclear
programme.  
  
"The Obama Administration initially placed emphasis aboard diplomatic
oath,[christian louboutin heels](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ),merely has become increasingly
frustrated with Iran," Cababrese narrated Xinhua.  
  
Washington adopted a twin alley approximate that sought apt reserve open the
possibility of diplomatic engagement meantime increasing economic oppression
on Iran. As a outcome U.S. and Israeli plans had come into closer composition
he said.  
  
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES  
  
The United States and Israel have vary views of the timing and spent benefits
of launching prevention strikes aboard Iran,said Anthony Cordesman, Arleigh A.
Burke preside in strategy at the Center as Strategic and International
Studies,[ferragamo 財布](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ), a height political think tank here.  
  
In the past two years, the United States had made it explicit by about every
level -- the chancellor secretary of state, secretary of barricade and
governor of the joint chiefs -- that it contrary one Israeli strike at this
phase and wanted to pursue diplomacy and sanctions, he mentioned.  
  
Speaking to influential pro-Israeli lobby team American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) aboard Sunday, Obama mentioned always options are aboard the
desk apt handle with Iranian nuclear
issue,[ティンバーランドスニーカー](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/products_all.html
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/products_all.html" ),merely he
accented he accepted to solve it through diplomatic channels.  
  
Israel,aboard the other hand, thinks military action namely needed forward it
namely too late.  
  
"Unlike their Israeli counterparts U.S. officials have always been fast to
temper these remarks along insisting that diplomacy has neither been tired nor
forsook Cababrese mentioned.  
  
As a global power, the United States has the incentive to chase a diplomatic
solution to the emergency something Israel, a regional player,lacks.  
  
Moreover, a nuclear Iran poses one existential threat apt Israel,only only
presents a proliferation peril apt the United States.  
  
In this context, Washington focuses aboard preventing Iran from procuring a
nuclear weapon,meantime Jerusalem stresses stopping Iran from getting a
"nuclear weapons capability,[paul smith
suit](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" )," Cababrese mentioned.  
  
Tanter agreed saying the United States could afford to await longer along
performing militarily for it had a greater aptitude to damage Iran's
facilities.  
  
But Israel, with a weaker military capability felt it needed to doing forward
Iran made its nuclear facilities inaccessible.  
  
OBAMA BOUGHT MORE TIME?  
  
However, analysts said the U.S.-Israeli distinctions were more superficial
than substantial.  
  
Cordesman mentioned the meeting of the two presidents would have given Israel
confidence that the United States looked halting the Iranian effort as fussy
and would keep the naval option open,while the United States was more certain
Israel might await for the sanctions to kick surrounded.  
  
Netanyahu's junket to Washington could be considered successful, as Obama
reconfirmed the U.S. commitment apt Israel's security as "rock solid,among
return as Israel postponing a strike aboard Iran, he said.  
  
Tanter mentioned the possibility of military action was "lower afterward the
meeting," and Obama had purchased more duration as negotiations and sanctions
to go.  
  
Obama maybe had persuaded Israel apt accede apt let the negotiation process
play out as at least six months, Tanter said,joining the U.S. decision apt
respond favorably apt an Iranian letter apt EU alien policy capital Catherine
Ashton appeared apt indicate there might soon be a de-escalation of combat
chat and a resumption of talks to negotiate a access out of the new impasse.  
  
Meanwhile, Tanter warned the convert of naval action would ascend
precipitately if the talks with Iran failed apt happen alternatively broke
down.  
  
Despite the distinctions by Monday's summit, which some trusted could impaired
the U.S.-Israeli relationship in the near future Cordesman said he accepted to
outlook the summit in a political context.  
  
"This was a political meeting within a political year It had merit as
political symbolism,barely little impact aboard both nation's underlying
strategy alternatively priorities," he said. Related articles：

section: New smoking ban effective in China" )]

##  New smoking ban effective in China

BEIJING, May?two (Xinhuanet) -- This year's May Day also marks the exterior of
a modish smoking ban surrounded China. The judgment longing application apt
always public indoor spaces -- including restaurants, bars,[フェラガモ
シューズ](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ), Internet cafes, and public
transport. But for the regulation comes into force, our reporter Wang Guan
finds that violators are still many and a bigger question namely whether the
vaguely worded rules might be also feeble apt acquaint a real difference.  
  
Bigger signs remind people that,starting aboard May first,always indoor public
locations should be smoke-free,either inside and out.  
  
But by many indoor venues nigh Beijing, some still take chances, and think
they'll obtain away with lighting up,equitable like ahead.  
  
Zhang Zhiqiang is a cumbersome smoker. He says he tried to kick the accustomed
a few times and failed. He adds that a deeply entrenched smoking civilization
in China makes it quite perplexing apt discontinue.  
  
Zhang Zhiqiang, Smoker, said, "I am addicted apt clouding I aspiration die if
I abandon smoking Furthermore, it's hard to acquaint friends or do affair
without smoking Presenting cigarettes to others namely a huge part of our
civilization"  
  
The fashionable regulation mandates a discipline of up to 30-thousand yuan,or
fewer than five-thousand US dollars,for owners of establishments that fail to
block smokers. But it's still illegible who will enforce the ban, what actions
trigger a fine and,[ポールスミス ネクタイピン](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" ),maximum importantly,[ポールスミス
靴](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ), what the discipline ought be for
individuals who light up.  
  
Before these questions can be answered by the authorities, many already fear
the prevailing rules are insufficient to mainly restrain smokers from puffing
amid public.  
  
Wang Yuanliang, Non-smoker, said, "The ban ought be harsher. I hate people who
smoke I can't stand them. It harms additional people's health. It also
infringes upon additional people's rights."  
  
Zhang Liyuan, Non-smoker,[クリスチャンセンター](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ), said, "Those who cigarette among
public indoor areas ought think about babies the aged and pregnant ladies who
became martyrs of their dirty action"  
  
China has the world's largest smoking population -- 350 million. In additional
words,an of every three smokers aboard the planet comes from China. And among
this country,three,000 folk dead each daytime from smoking-related
diseases,onward apt the World Health Organization. Cigarette smoke contributes
to four of the five leading causes of death around the nation.  
  
But so distant only 20 percent of the adults among China deem smoking causes
cancer,alternatively additional health problems.  
  
Many specialists feel a want of public education wars that the reason for this
learning breach.  
  
Xiang Fan,[クリスチャンルブタン セール](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), Head Patrol Officer of Beijing
Liuliqiao Transport Hub, said, "We attempt apt stop each smoker we blot in
this hall,but often those who are caught respond quite strongly, and give us a
hard duration I think it ambition be a long and arduous process to acquaint
public areas cigarette free. People need better awareness."  
  
The ultimate obstacle apt enforcing a smoking ban could be the ministry itself
... which has a direct peg surrounded the industry. The China National Tobacco
Corporation is a state-owned cigarette monopoly, and the largest company of
this type within the world.  
  
According apt the China Daily,approximately 8 percentage of the country's
revenue came from taxes and profits associated to tobacco among 2009.  
  
"It's not equitable age habits that dead hard. Experts mention smokers
redouble physical, psychological, and social needs for clouding over period
And apt annihilate nicotine addiction, it takes stronger awareness wars and
comprehensive remedial processes, rather than simply posting more no-smoking
signs among public venues. Wang Guan, CCTV, Beijing."

##  News analysis Israeli arms sale to Azerbaijan likely to ange

JERUSALEM,[ポールスミス バッグ メンズ](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ), Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel plans
apt sell advanced naval equipment apt Azerbaijan in a handle worth an.six
billion U.S.greenbacks,along apt Israeli middling.  
  
The handle will include unmanned supernal conveyances (UAVs), as well as anti-
aircraft and missile barricade systems. Both the type of equipment and its
destination are likely to generate a negative response from Iran, which
recently accused Azerbaijan of granting Israeli spies apt conduct operations
against the Iranian nuclear agenda among its territories.  
  
Iran says its nuclear programme namely as generating electricity,meantime
Israel and much Western countries debate that it namely a cover as producing
nuclear weapons.  
  
Analysts told Xinhua that while the handle would reinforce Azerbaijan's knots
with Israel and probably support its ambition to gain closer ties with the
West, there namely a long history of tensions between Azerbaijan and Iran even
without the Israeli dimension.  
  
"The ties with Azerbaijan heightens the isolation and encirclement of Iran,
which in edge serve as a precursor to ultimately target its nuclear facilities
militarily," Barak Seener from the Royal United Services Institute in London
told Xinhua aboard Monday.  
  
Israel sees a nuclear-armed Iran as an existential threat. It likewise has
concerns that Iranian leagues the Islamic Hamas action and Hezbollah, would
accomplish greater deterrence against Israel below an Iranian nuclear
umbrella.  
  
Seener debated that Israel has so distant been focusing its efforts aboard
dealing with the nuclear issue by targeting scientists connected apt the
agenda and by engaging in cyber warfare. In the last six months there have
likewise been explosions by sites that may be connected to the agenda which
have resulted in either loss of life and national damage.  
  
While Israel has never commented aboard these allegations, several high-level
officials have expressed their satisfaction over the results of these attacks.  
  
However, Seener believes that "Israel could have engaged much more with the
Iranian opposition in destabilizing the regime from surrounded and has failed
apt do so."  
  
"It has instead focused on creating an external network of unions to isolate
the (Iranian) regime and ultimately target nuclear facilities," he added.  
  
Dr. Soli Shahvar from the University of Haifa said that the handle namely
important apt Israel as the strong knots with Azerbaijan ambition in a large
part work as a counterweight apt the influence that Iran yields over Hamas in
Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon.  
  
"Of lesson Israel can't operate with the Azerbaijani authority in the same
fashion that Iran can do with Hezbollah and Hamas,merely there is some variety
of cooperation,[Timberland Shoes
Online](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/" )," Shahvar said.  
  
"Azerbaijan namely penetrated by Iran as an major component in a strategic
axis against its interests in the region, so this in itself brings tension,"
he added.  
  
Shahvar mentioned that whatever Azerbaijan namely viewed as secular, Iran
identified it as an of the countries that it would strive to export its
prototype of Islamic administration deserving apt its tremendous Shiite
population.  
  
But the efforts failed,[フェラガモ プールオム](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ), and in the early 1990s Iran angered
Azerbaijan by supporting Christian Armenians in the combat over the Nagorno-
Karabakh region,[メンズ ティンバーランド カスタム](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/
"http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/" ), an enclave inside Muslim
Azerbaijan.  
  
"Another point of tension between Azerbaijan and Iran namely how the natural
resources below the Caspian Sea ought be divided," Shahvar said.  
  
According to the age agreement that Iran reached with the Soviet Union, the
resources ought be split 50-50. However,back the collapse of the Soviet Union
a digit of current nations emerged and always wanted the oil.  
  
While Iran discussed that it was up apt these current nations to separate the
half that belonged apt the Soviet Union,not final approval has been
approached.  
  
Shahvar debated that meantime the tension with Israel namely important to
Iran, the skirmish as control of the Caspian Sea fuel is even more important.  
  
Oil and natural gas exports are the main sources of income for the Iranian
authority The new and tougher sanctions recently imposed by the United States

##  记者

** 记者：**在收支不平衡的情况下,[Timberland Shop](http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/ "http://www.timberlandbootsonlinejp.com/" )，专业人士是否仍然愿意在此工作？ 

** 记者：**MYMIND并不是医院，如何处理一些紧急情况？ 

** KrystianFikert：**一种方案还是进行在线咨询。目前，在线医生和在线咨询也很流行，医生可以通过网络、摄像头或者其他方式在城市中为位于很远的人提供这样的治疗；另一种方案解决这样的问题，可以培训一些专业人士，但从长远角度来看，这样花费的时间以及经历都过于长。因此我们还是会把工作站设立在大一点的城市，通过招募城市中的志愿者为更多更远地区的人们提供服务。 

** KrystianFikert：**是的。我们有22名职业的心理学专家、2名心理医生和16名心理咨询师及辅导员。心理专家与我们的合作不是全天的，根据他们的情况，有的可能一周只工作３到５个小时，虽然在这里得到的薪酬肯定要比他们自己的正式工作低很多，但大部分人还是很愿意坚持下去。在爱尔兰，很多人还是认为，从社会中获得一些利益以后，也有责任为社会回馈一些。从MYMIND这个机构自身来说，我们也有很好的管理方式，可以协调各个专家的时间，让他们可以与正式工作分开，安心在MYMIND工作。

width="399" height="264" /&gt;

提高服务水平获得患者信任

**记者：**MYMIND维持运转的资金来源有哪些？KrystianFikert：MYMIND是一个非营利性的社会企业，我们会与企业进行一些合作，不断提高我们的服务以及必要的援助，来满足这些客户的需求，这些客户所支付的款项，我们用于帮助那些没有支付能力的求助者，目前我们60%的开支来自于客户付费所得，40%来自于私人慈善机构的捐款以及政府的补助。我们计划通过扩大服务范围，在2015年实现收支平衡。

“取富济贫”的社会企业服务模式

&lt;/span&gt;

**记者：**为什么在爱尔兰成立了ＭＹＭＩＮＤ这样一个机构？ 

因此2006年我创立了MYMIND，它向每个人开放，目前在都柏林的两个社区内运行，除了面对面的心理咨询，还提供在线的心理及精神健康服务。

良好的管理模式吸引合作伙伴

** KrystianFikert：**信任需要逐步建立，这也是在线咨询的优势之一，求助者发来信息进行求助，这是求助者跨出自己心理障碍的第一步，在这个时候，我们给出相应的解决办法，如果这个答案对于他们有意义，他们就会要求进行面对面的沟通。还有很重要的一个因素就是口碑，有一些求助者在这里经过治疗以后，觉得还不错，他们也可以选择在网络上进行一些回馈，同时我们也会在公共交通及杂志上刊登广告。 

** KrystianFikert：**求助者肯定会有不满意的情况。单从技术上来说，比如网站注册等等。关于治疗方面，如果遇到投诉等问题，他们会选择先检查心理专家对求助者的治疗过程是否符合求助者本身的情况，如果的确是专家在治疗程序或其他方面出现问题，我们可以给求助者进行更换。

** 记者：**机构有受到过质疑吗？ 

――KrystianFikert

**KrystianFikert：**万事开头难，一开始我们没有地方、也没有资金、没有客户资源也没有团队，所以很难吸引到一些人。 

**记者**：MYMIND有哪些优势能为患者解决他们的心理问题？ 

MYMIND注重的是早期干预，尽量不使用药物治疗。心理健康早期干预包含抑制抑郁情绪、焦虑症状等等，我们认为早期干预有助于更好的心理治疗结果，以防这些心理健康
问题升级。

** 记者：**从最初只有你一个人到现在拥有40人的一个团队，在这个过程中，你认为最困难的是什么？ 

**KrystianFikert：**主要的求助群体，其实还是一些轻微心理健康困扰的人，比如抑郁或有自杀倾向的人,[ポールスミスウィメン](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" )，如果遇到一些患有严重心理疾病的人，我们也会把他们转到正规医院去进行治疗，因此MYMIND跟当地一些医院都有合作，有些时候，医院也会向一些人推荐到MYMIND。

**■人物简介 MYMIND创始人兼执行总裁。**

** 记者：**中国区域差别很大，贫困地区有很大的缺口，在这些方面MYMIND有没有一些想法？ 

** KrystianFikert：**大约超过15％的爱尔兰人会面临一些心理健康问题，而爱尔兰心理健康卫生系统并没有足够的能力可以解决这一日益增长的现状。 

** 记者：**MYMIND是如何吸引更多的求助者去进行咨询的？ 

对于我来说，最难的还是进行MYMIND的经营，我本身并不擅长商业经营，本专业也并不在此，因此，在这方面我还是一个初学者，需要继续学习。

** 记者：**MYMIND的运作模式在中国的可行性高吗？ 

**KrystianFikert：**对于一些需要心理健康支持的人，可能在３到４个工作日内就可以与心理治疗专家进行面对面的沟通，其次就是经济实惠，一般对于求助者，分为三个等级，第一个等级是普通人都可以支付得起的费用，这个价格大约只是公共医疗的一半，第二个等级是对于有社会低保的一些人，价格会更低,[ジョーダン バッシュ](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/ "http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" )，第三个等级则是对于一些贫困人群，我们直接提供给他们免费的治疗。 

** 记者：**有些患者可能碍于面子问题羞于求助，你是怎么说服他们去接受心理咨询的？ 

我们赚取付费客户的资金用于帮助那些不能全额付款的心理求助者。

我曾经有两年供职于谷歌，利用空闲开展MYMIND的工作。一开始我把工作地点设在了教堂旁边的一间小屋里，因为是免费提供的，后来有人愿意跟我一起，我们就开始租日
租房，每个周末为更多的人提供服务。直到2008年，才有了固定的工作站。刚开始的时候我们也没有这个在线咨询系统，虽然我本身学的是心理学专业，但我对电脑也很感兴
趣，经过一段时间努力，通过自学，我自己设计了网站，从最开始，网站设计的不堪入目，到慢慢变得越来越简单易懂，这个是我比较满意的。

** KrystianFikert：**我认为MYMIND在中国是可行的，这次行程主要是为了了解中国的情况，准备在中国设立工作点。初步计划，可能还是通过在线咨询的方式开始，经过一段时间与沟通以后，才会进行面对面的服务，主要是通过一些机构以及下设心理学专业的大学进行合作，比如北京大学，邀请具有心理学专业的学生，给予一些帮助，加入MYMIND的团队，同时我们会招募一些专家。我也很希望能与中国政府的相关部门有一个沟通。 

中国工作点首选大城市

本报记者侯雪竹

2月17日，MYMIND创始人兼执行总裁KrystianFikert首次来到中国，推介他的公益组织模式，这个在爱尔兰成长起来的公益组织，通过建立网站解决当地
人群的心理健康问题。作为一个非营利性的社会企业，借助“富取贫济”式的运作模式,[ポールスミス
ネクタイ](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" )，帮助那些被抑郁、焦虑或是工作压力困扰的求助者。自2006年起，这个组织从仅有
一个人和一个网络平台，已经发展到现在拥有40人的团队，MYMIND累计为超过4000人提供了心理健康支持,[ポールスミス
かばん](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/ "http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
)，目前MYMIND的创始人来到中国，希望在这里建立一个心灵小屋，利用互联网的优势，让更多人可以获得心理救助。

在爱尔兰的公共医疗方面，患者可能需要等待６到８个月甚至更长的时间，才能与心理医生进行约见，但如果选用私人治疗，患者需要支付昂贵的服务费用给私人心理治疗师。同
时，一些爱尔兰人会因自己存有心理问题感觉羞愧，不愿意接受心理治疗，导致问题越来越严重。

**KrystianFikert：**其实很多人不太希望面对面或在电话中，表明自己是一个精神有问题的人，他们不愿意被别人认为自己存在一些精神疾病，但是相较于电话沟通，打字就没有任何问题，他们可以把自己作为第三方，比如他们会在网上采取匿名的方式，或重新申请一个邮箱地址，与MYMIND的工作人员交流。我们会先采取网上交流的方式，等到时机成熟，求助者放下心理负担的时候，再约请电话沟通或面对面的心理治疗。

pistoling down two U. S. senior advisors by a unknown man inside the premise
of the fortified Afghan Interior Ministry at Saturday daylight has taken many
into surprise.  
  
The bloody incident coincided with the week-long roomy demonstrations within
Afghan cities since Tuesday apt protest the Quran scalding by a garbage pit at
the main U.S. airbase amid Bagram north of Kabul.  
  
"I confidence shooting inside the Interior Ministry which namely responsible
for ensuring judgment and series amid the country,[paul smith
japan](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" ),amid fact speaks of Taliban
penetration into security entities," political analyst Rahman Ughlo told
Xinhua aboard Sunday.  
  
The ministry in a statement said, "The man who annihilated two American
advisors aboard Saturday and who that said apt be an employee of the Interior
Ministry namely by enormous and police quest operation to spot and occupy the
suspect that continuing."  
  
The Taliban outfit fighting Afghan and NATO-led forces has attested
responsibility as the assault inflating the slew apt four.  
  
In a sharp reaction, the U.S.administration has recalled forever U.S.
nationals serving with the Afghan authority bodies in and approximately the
king which was shortly followed by Britain.  
  
However, Ughlo was of the perspective that the assassinate of two advisors
would not oppress U.S.apt accelerate troop pullout, rather it would overshadow
the deem of international community apt the Afghan administration.  
  
"I don't think the U.S.ambition build up crew drawdown process following the
assassination of two advisors,whether so, Americans aspiration not remain
secure from dread attacks even among Washington," the sometime Afghan lawmaker
advised.  
  
Commenting aboard the on-going protests, Ughlo believed that chanting
anti-U.S. slogans over the past six days is indicative of U.S.misdeed
investment over the past ten-year amid Afghanistan.  
  
Protestors within the ever-longest demonstration since deployment of U.S.
forces surrounded Afghanistan within late 2001 have expressed their
resentments by hurrahing slogans and calling as discipline of those
responsible for the blasphemy doing a demand backed by President Hamid Karzai.  
  
Over 30 folk including four Americans have been annihilated and accessory than
200 others injured throughout the unprecedented anti-U.S. demonstrations
surrounded Afghanistan. Sunday's protests staged surrounded northern Samangan
and Kunduz provinces also led to an death and injuries of two dozens including
seven Americans.  
  
In the wake of the killing of two American advisors, the U.S.administrator of
NATO-led Inernational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) , General John R.
Allen, has recalled his forces from Afghan military installations and
ministries.  
  
"For apparent compel protection reasons, I have likewise taken immediate
measures apt recall all other ISAF personnel working in ministries among and
nearly Kabul," Allen said within a statement late Saturday night.  
  
The decision,[ルブタン バレエシューズ](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ),by to Afghan analysts,that a sign of
tumbling trust apt the Afghan administration.  
  
"No mistrust shooting inside the Interior Ministry reduces the confidence
towards security apparatus and reduces the trust of the coalition forces and
international agencies towards the administration and recalling NATO advisors
from the ministries namely a testimony to the fact,[christian
louboutin](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" )," Kabul-based security analyst Wahid
Mujda observed.  
  
Agreeing on the notion, Afghan political onlooker and Kabul University
professor Faizullah Jalal warned that repeating insurgents attacks inside
administration sectors would abuse the credibility of Afghan security entities
and eventually reduces the believe of international community towards the
Afghan government.  
  
"Attack inside the Interior Ministry equitable months next raid inside the
Defense Ministry namely a explicit indication of the penetration of militants
and terrorists into the government bodies which makes it possible for them apt
target anyone anytime they deficiency Jalal told Xinhua.  
  
He said that the evacuation of alien advisors from Afghan ministries works
against the national interests at this stage. Related articles：

newly-discovered galaxies are extreme even as the juvenile universe -- while
most galaxies were forming stars at higher rates than they are today.
Astronomers using Hubble's instruments could blot the galaxies because the
radiation from juvenile,hot stars has reasoned the oxygen amid the gas
circling them to light up like a shine neon sign.

Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS),one intent three- anniversary learn apt

"In addition to the images,[paul smith

us the oxygen amid a handful of galaxies and confirmed their utmost star-
forming nature," said co-author Amber Straughn at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center. "Spectra are prefer fingerprints. They tell us the galaxies' chemical
composition."  
  
The CANDELS team disclosed the 69 juvenile pygmy galaxies amid near- infrared
images taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera as Surveys.  
  
The observations suggest that the newly-discovered galaxies were very common

##  NASA spacecraft data suggest Mars may have flowing saltwater

WASHINGTON, Aug.four (Xinhua) -- Observations from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter have revealed possible streaming water during the warmest months
aboard Mars, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
announced Thursday.  
  
Dark, finger-like features arise and stretch down some Martian slopes during
late spring through summer,fade among winter, and return during the next
spring. Repeated observations have tracked the seasonal changes surrounded
these recurring features on several soak slopes amid the media latitudes of
Mars' southern hemisphere.  
  
"The best explanation as these observations so distant is the flow of briny
water,[ポールスミス ネクタイ](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" )," said Alfred McEwen of the University
of Arizona,[ポールスミス ショルダーバッグ](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ), Tucson.  
  
McEwen is the principal investigator as the orbiter's High Resolution Imaging
Science Experiment and adviser author of a report almost the recurring flows
to be published surrounded Friday's edition of the daily Science.  
  
Seven such sites aboard the planet have been confirmed,[ルブタン
店舗](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), with 20 more possible McEwen said.  
  
"What makes these present observations so interesting namely they happen by
much lower latitudes where temperatures are much warmer and where it's truly
feasible as fluid water apt
exist,[サルバトーレフェラガモ](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_all.html
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_all.html" )," said Arizona State
University geophysicist Phil Christensen,an of the scientists who studied the
images beamed back from the orbiter.  
  
The learn does not guarantee water exists,merely identifies it as the best
explanation. It's worthwhile to think nearly alternative reasons as these
observations,merely none seems to qualified as well as briny water, McEwen
said.  
  
"I think it's working apt be laboratory experiments aboard Earth that give us
the best confirmation alternatively refutation,&lt;a

class, digital imaging and materials science company," he said.  
  
According apt the company, only Kodak and its U.S. subsidiaries are part of
the reorganization and Kodak ambition continue to serve forever clients nearly
the world during the process.  
  
"Chapter 11 does never mean Kodak that going out of affair said Perez. "We are
taking this tread at this point among our transformation in array apt build

Then came the painful restructurings,one after repeatedly only failed to
reserve the company from falling.  
  
"As membrane began its path apt obsolescence, Kodak missed the chance on
several occasions apt bound into the digital earth It first underestimated the
clash that digital would have aboard its business and then it ignored what it
might mean for its business Once it tried to bound within it was distant too
late," said Robert Salomon,[paul smith

School of Business who focuses aboard how firms administer to modernize and
retain a appealing position amid the universal economy.

duration aspiration be susceptible to many diseases in the rest of their life.  
  
Historically, elder family members, especially mother-in-laws were expected
apt oversee the confinement duration while today the task is mostly quit

According apt McAfee's third quarter security report,[フェラガモ 靴

pieces of code targeted Android jumped almost 37 percent since the second 15
min.  
  
The company has raised its prediction for 2011 to 75 million uncommon malware
specimens up by five million compared with the projection made at the end of
last annual.  
  
The daily of 2011 that set apt be the busiest surrounded malware history, said
McAfee.  
  
One of the most popular forms of malware among the third quarter was sending
Trojans amongst short messages that gather personal information and embezzle
money.  
  
McAfee's report showed that some current malware also records users '
conversations and forwards them apt the attacker.

malware. Compared with Apple's stiff rules aboard its App Store, Android's
ecosystem is more open merely relatively chaotic. As anybody developer can

Unlike Apple which makes, maintains and takes complete control over the iPhone

Android phones and constantly tweak the software. It also falls on the mobile
carriers,never Google,to shake out security updates to customers.  
  
As inverse to iPhone owners who typically reserve their devices always their
lives, Android buyers tend apt buy current phones each 12 to 18 months, which
makes contractors and mobile carriers consistently focused aboard bringing out
the latest prototype,never aboard nailing security flaws that yet exist, said
Harry Sverdlove,capital technology commander for Massachusetts-based security
fixed Bit9.  
  
Meanwhile, a majority of Android consumers are ignorant of their phone's
security flaws since they have never been caught surrounded one raid The

##  La Mer海蓝之谜尊享密集焕颜精华液 - 新华时尚 - 新华网

如此尊贵、神奇的产品，有幸亲眼目睹的人，当然不会太多。由于神奇活性精萃、休眠酵素、海洋培植酵素的发酵过程，都需要数周甚至数月的时间，再加上原材料的产地和采摘
时间十分特殊（比如神奇活性精萃中的深海巨藻，只能于一年的春秋两季采摘），因此，手工制作的The
Essence制作周期非常漫长，产量更是十分有限。所以，它的销售方式也与普通的专柜销售有所不同。只有La
Mer最忠实最尊贵的VIP顾客才能获得品牌发出的私人邀请，由顶级房车专程接送至高级酒店或豪华会所中，享受 “一对一”的详细介绍,[フェラガモ
バッグ](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/ "http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/"
)。并且，每位顾客只能购买一套。至于未受到邀请，而又想要一试这款21天密集深层产品的客人，只能排进“Waiting
List”，耐心地慢慢等待。要知道，在美国，当它面市的消息传出时，一周内就有了一张包括无数明星名人的600人等候名单。

可以想象一款护肤品的价格高达人民币两万多元吗？而且，还只能用短短的21天？更夸张的是，有钱也不一定买得到？这个令绝大多数人感觉疯狂的理念，却被顶级护肤品牌L
a Mer海蓝之谜变成了现实――The Essence尊享密集焕颜精华液。这款堪称终极尊贵、在全世界都仅作极限量发售的护肤品，不单售价高居护肤品之冠，更是全
球第一款能让肌肤得到彻底休息、充电和修护的产品，能令肌肤焕发出难以置信的新生光彩。

与此同时，为了将神奇活性精萃的修复功效提升到前所未有的境界，The Essence尊享密集焕颜精华液中还加入了两种特殊的酵素――休眠酵素（The
Dormancy Ferment）和海洋培植酵素（The Mariponic
Ferment）。休眠酵素的核心是水仙球茎精华，它天然的休眠特性能令肌肤进入休息状态，从而使受损的细胞得以休养生息。当La
Mer实验室利用低温生物发酵过程，并配合以红光和紫外线波长的能量,[paul smith
women](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/"
)，把水仙球茎制作为休眠酵素后，它丰富的抗氧化和抗敏感成分还能有效舒缓外界环境和压力对肌肤带来的负面影响。

The Essence尊享密集焕颜精华液的包装也可谓匠心独具。它延续了品牌一贯低调简约的作风，但又十分注重实用性,[エアジョーダン1](http://www
.airjordansalejapan.com/ "http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/" )。21天用量的精华液，被等分在
三管15毫升装的深祖母绿色玻璃瓶内，每一管可以用一星期。它们被储放于具有磁能的透明底座上，这一充满磁能的环境能令成分内的电荷值始终处于最佳最稳定的状态。而每
一管精华液的瓶底更含有一枚磁石，和底座上的异极磁石协同作用，确保成分的活跃性和新鲜度。还是用手机来作比喻，放在磁能底座上的精华液相当于不断地被充着电，使用时
才会最“电力十足”。

提起La Mer，不得不提到神秘广袤的大海,[ポールスミス 財布](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" )。从品牌诞生之日起，就与大海结下了不解之缘。已然成为护肤界经典传奇的La
Mer海蓝之谜精华面霜，其核心神奇活性精萃（Miracle
BrothTM）便是以手工采摘自太平洋的深海巨藻为主要成分，再经过3至4个月低温生物发酵，其间更要配合声音与光线的能量，才能焕发出惊人的修复能力。如今，La
Mer成功地将海蓝之谜精华面霜中最纯粹、最珍贵的神奇活性精萃浓缩到最极致的程度，研发出The
Essence尊享密集焕颜精华液，从而在21天的密集护理中，极大地促进肌肤自我愈合和修复。

The Essence的功效称得上无与伦比：使用后，肌肤拥有前所未有的清澈度、光泽感和活力，呈现出年轻肌肤所特有的平滑与柔嫩，不仅触感极佳,&lt;a
href="<http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/>" style="color: black; text-

BEIJING,?Oct.three?(Xinhuanet) -- Ziqian not his real name merely an avatar he
uses online) namely amid Paris working aboard his master's degree,barely he
stays among close touch with his contacts among China through Sina Corp's
Weibo, a micro blog platform. It was a pleasant access apt reserve up with
acquaintances. But that always changed when Ziqian quoted a blog post from an
alumnus of his alma mater, Nanjing University,aboard July five It said the
school did not organize students to sing Red songs at the outset July an the
90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Ziqian
suddenly base himself inundated with comments from enraged bloggers whom he
didn't know. He had lost all integrity, they said.  
  
Ziqian spent the plenary night arguing with one netizen who assailed him with
insults. He was left feeling tired and puzzled.  
  
He said he would have given up micro-blogging altogether as "purely
useless"but he uses it to linger within touch with his girlfriend.  
  
Micro-blogging has been growing quickly dwarfing the many additional forms of
social networking that came into being only three alternatively four years
ago.  
  
Famed for spreading messages about instantly and supervising the doings of
agencies and organizations,little blogs have already won some notable wars.  
  
In March, micro-bloggers argued the metropolis of Nanjing, Jiangsu
province,apt spare 600 age trees that were to be cut down; they also organized
donation to earthquake sufferers in Japan.  
  
In July, they brought the Red Cross Society of China and additional
philanthropies underneath scrutiny.  
  
But,favor everything among life, there is likewise a downside apt micro-
blogging.  
  
In the Weibo-dominated virtual globe Ziqian's experience has testified a
common accident A 28-year-old woman, surnamed
Zhang,[フェラガモベルト](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/" ), who declined apt expose her full appoint
works by a TV station in Jiangsu province. She recounted her recent encounter
with online abusive comments.  
  
After watching a new aptitude show, Zhang wrote half-jokingly online - without
using her real designate - that the agenda was boring and lacked imagination.
Regarding herself as an "industry insider", Zhang deemed her reasoning had
some objective basis.  
  
Nevertheless, she was soon confronted with a wave of annotation some of it
vulgar, saying she had not appreciation for the masterpieces.  
  
"I was quite depressed by the comments It's prefer you obtain kidnapped by
mainstream opinion," she said. "I lost the appetite apt share my outlooks with
others."  
  
"I worship the deliverance of lecture doctrine, and everyone namely allowed to
proclaim his alternatively her thoughts," Zhang wrote in a separate post. "But
don't cast random assaults by others and take as granted that whatever you say
namely fact"  
  
Micro blogs have also made some ordinary folk famous,nevertheless never among
the way they would favor.  
  
Zhang Mingyi, 22,[paul smith ネクタイ](http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanesale.com/" ),namely an such person.  
  
After seeming on a dating show aboard Shanghai-based Dragon TV,[paul smith
suit](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ), she said her mini blog inboxes were
fraught each daytime with letters lashing out at her,for of her open a
standing ovation Japanese civilization and a failed marriage.  
  
Some netizens are cruel within their indignation of her. Even her mini blog
followers received omens to linger away from the "quisling". One such message
read: "Go differentiate her to marry a Japanese man. Don't act so shamelessly
amid China".  
  
Similarly, Guo Meimei,immediately a household nominate said she was being
stalked and even threatened in early September,afterward she bragged among a
mini blog post virtually her wealth and - untruthfully - claimed apt clutch a
position at the Red Cross Society of China.  
  
Bloggers fired a vast activity boycotting a song she released online and an
online game she endorsed. They satirized her plastic surgeries and gossiped
almost her whereabouts. In a recent interview with China Daily, Guo said the
animosity she stirred was so intense that she had even considered suicide.  
  
"I feel prefer I am an enemy of the state," she said. "The truth is that I am
equitable a fatuous girl who did something really stupid No matter what I do,
nobody wants to forgive me."  
  
Celebrities are more likely to chance the targets of the word-of-mouth
maelstrom online. Yang Lan,for example a famous TV anchorwoman, came beneath
colossal suppression as bloggers dug into her connections with China-Africa
Hope Project,[christian louboutin shoes
sale](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ), an organization set up by a
prominent philanthropist, Lu Junqing, that became controversial for he
empowered his 24-year-old daughter apt supervise the charity's substantial
donated asset.  
  
Bloggers questioned whether the intention of Lu's initiative was generosity
alternatively cashing surrounded aboard donators. Rumors held sway on little
blogs.  
  
A recent study from University of Michigan suggests that it that certain that
folk distinguish between the fact and unfounded rumors among online social
middling where vast amounts of information are easily scatter across a large
network by sources of unverified administration.  
  
According apt Xie Gengyun, author of the 2010 China Micro Blog Annual Report
and agent dean at the Arts and Humanities Research Institute at Shanghai
Jiaotong University,mini blogs can generate and scatter unfounded rumors, such
as the "Shanxi earthquake" and "Louis Cha's death".  
  
"Micro-bloggers are currently the better-educated folk amid China. But
consumers longing soon include those by the grassroots class and the function
of micro blogs ambition different from celebrity-watching apt online
socializing and venting nearly life's disappointments," Xie said.  
  
China's Internet, with more registered consumers than any additional
nation,[ジョーダン 5](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/products_all.html
"http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/products_all.html" ),namely a spirited
forum for public opinion, said Xinhua News Agency. But "concocting rumors is
itself a social sickness and the scatter of rumors across the Internet
presents a massive social threat."  
  
The micro blog platform tends to breed more rumors and assaults than
additional channels for of the limited amount of personas each post can
use,along apt Xiong Yihan, a sociologist with Fudan University.  
  
"The word restrict has made it hard to present a balanced and equitable
opinion. Besides, posts with utmost outlooks are more likely apt be forwarded
online,for they satisfy people's thirst as the unknown Xiong said.  
  
Xiong said Internet companies ought suspend the accounts of users who strew
rumors alternatively libelous statements.

##  NASA exploring ways to clean up space debris - Xinhua Engli

by Mark Weisenmiller  
  
TAMPA, United States, March eleven (Xinhua) -- Facing the increasing threats
of area debris,[フェラガモ 通販](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/specials.html
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/specials.html" ), the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) is actively exploring ways to clean up the
external place.  
  
Donald Kessler, an astrophysicist by NASA's Environmental Effects Office, said
the district industry has been slowly developing ideas for over 30 years
aboard how apt proceed to clean up place junk,merely none has ever been fully
tested.  
  
Space debris comes from asteroids,
comets,[クリスチャンルブタンジャパン](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), meteorites and also defunct man-made
district devices alternatively their portions"Dead" satellites are an instance
of zone debris, which poses increasing risks to functional satellites and the
International Space Station.  
  
Kessler,[サルバトーレフェラガモ](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/" ), the 1st chief of NASA's Orbital Debris
Program Office, said there are three fundamental issues apt be decided among
relation to the cleaning up of district junk.  
  
"One, how do we obtain apt the objects inexpensively? Two, how do we catch an
object that namely likely spinning and never designed to be grabbed?
Three,[ポールスミス カフス](http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/
"http://www.paulsmithjapanonlines.com/" ), what do we do with the entity back
grabbing it?" Kessler told Xinhua.  
  
Another truth to consider namely that astrophysicists and scientists have been
slow apt residence the heading To citation merely an case, NASA does never
annually spend any administration asset with regard apt the research and the
cleaning up of area junk.  
  
Size of area debris can be as small as one centimeter. Astrophysicists and
scientists have hardship putting exact definitions apt enormous"area debris.
However, usually an thing of 10 centimeters or greater is considered huge"  
  
International interest amid cleaning up zone debris has increased in recent
years especially since February 2009,while two false satellites collided at
about 490 miles almost 790 km) over Siberia, creating over an,000 pieces of
area debris.  
  
Kessler, the creator of what namely understood as the "Kessler Syndrome,"
believes that an increasing frequency of collision of space junk want create
"a permanent belt of space debris" that would be so thick that it would be a
danger to any tried launched rocket alternatively satellite.  
  
Two new possible ideas as cleaning up area debris are the use of mighty
lasers, whose projected laser beams would move the area junk into lower orbits
to be burnt up, and the creation of a matrix of nets apt capture some of the
place junk.  
  
Kessler,though thinks that neither concept would be a absolute solution,even
now they worked as planned.  
  
Numerous companies among North America are working aboard motley district junk
clean-up projects. One such company namely the Star Technology and Research
(STAR) in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.  
  
STAR that the recent receiver of approximately two million U.S.greenbacks from
NASA apt create a spacecraft called ElctroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE).  
  
If successfully made and operated, EDDE would target non-functioning orbiting
satellites that fathom an ton apiece.  
  
"EDDE will 'sail' aboard the Earth's acceptable field favor a sailing ship
among the wind, giving it unlimited range, using solar power. This is the
breakthrough technology that makes feasible the removal of entire colossal
dangerous debris objects amid cheap Earth orbit. We are working apt amplify
the components that acquaint EDDE feasible STAR spokesman Jerome Pearson told
Xinhua.  
  
According apt the chart EDDE would sail to an extinct satellite, using a
solar-powered six-mile long space rope line. It ambition after evict a huge
net apt catch the targeted satellite, and lower itself into a lower orbit. It
want blaze out the caught satellite into the Earth's ventilation where it
would afterward flame up. Once EDDE ejects the satellite, it
aspiration"navigate back up into higher orbit and continue to arrest
repeatedly non-operating satellite, Pearson explained.  
  
There are more than 2,000 tons of debris in cheap Earth orbit,beneath the
two,000-kilometer height EDDE could arrest and havoc of the larger die"area
satellites, Pearson said.  
  
But the main fashionable threat apt operational satellites and to the
astronauts on the International Space Station namely the untracked shrapnel
between an and ten centimeters among size, he said.  
  
"They are likewise small apt lane with new means,merely they are tremendous
enough to destroy a satellite alternatively puncture an ISS module."  
  
Pearson said the all international satellite bombard community ought logically
share among the burden of cleaning up area debris.  
  
NASA's new policies on zone debris were called into question by a report
released last September by the National Research Council, an affiliate of the
Academy of Sciences.  
  
"NASA ought collaborate with advertisement national, and international
agencies apt redouble more clear information nearly the costs of debris avoida
nce,[フェラガモバッグ](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82

East,thus attempting an opportunity for UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and
forever the 15 council members apt atmosphere their views aboard how to bring
an early annihilate apt the present emergency among Syria, which broke out
nearly a annual antecedent.  
  
All the speakers,one then repeatedly voiced their grave concerns aboard the
Syrian emergency and called for an immediate end apt the armed conflicts in
the Middle East nation where thousands of folk have been reportedly slew since
March 2011.  
  
The council meeting was important at this juncture. However,committee members
are still divided as to the characteristic measures aboard how apt put an end
to the new crisis surrounded Syria.  
  
"It namely important as the international community from time to time to win
splice and see what we can do to tell sure that these processes are working
naturally aboard the basis of the will of the folk of the nations of the
region, without outdoor interference, without imposing any prejudged solutions
apt a situation within one nation or repeatedly Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov told reporters here Monday by the end of the high- class
committee gathering.  
  
Indeed, a applicable solution to the Syrian emergency calls as extensive oath
of the international community, with the United Nations playing a leading
character merely always the relevant activities ought be well led according
the UN Charter and international verdict.  
  
PROPER SOLUTION  
  
The proper political solutions ought include an inclusive, Syrian-led
political process which must bring more gains than losses to the nation and
its people To this abolish the priority namely to guarantee that the political
process begins and develops in a peaceful and democratic manner with the
respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms of always the people within
the nation.  
  
In this sense, the outside interference that very change from appealing
bureaus of the international community on the Syrian emergency No pre-
conditions ought be attached apt the inclusive political dialogue and
political reform within Syria.  
  
At the Security Council, Russia, China and India, among others, were speaking
firmly against the alien intervention in the internal happenings of Syria.

speeches,among addition apt the ones presented to Syrian President Bashar al-
Assad forward the joint special envoy of the UN and Arab League for Syria,
Kofi Annan,when he met with the Syrian chancellor double over the weekend.  
  
But emigrant interference and recipes from outside which flee counter to the
principles and purposes of the UN Charter and the norms governing
international relations, are never conducive apt the political accommodation
of the Syrian emergency.  
  
"China opposes armed outer intervention alternatively pushing as ' regime
change'. Use alternatively threat of sanctions ambition never be profitable to
the suitable accommodation of the issue," Li Baodong, the Chinese permanent
representative apt the United Nations,[ジョーダン
パンツ](http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/ "http://www.airjordansalejapan.com/"

In kernel the unrest surrounded Syria,impartial like that in the West Asia and
North Africa which began more than a annual ago has its roots within the
desire of folk to activity a greater persona among shaping their destiny,
politically and economically.  
  
"These aspirations ambition not be met amongst violence alternatively armed
skirmish Hardeep Singh Puri, the Indian permanent representative apt the
United Nations, told the Security Council. "Nor can a solution be reached
amongst prescriptions from outside"  
  
"In truth given the history of foreign interference, such prescriptions will
never only be guess within the eyes of various sections of society only may
likewise have the latent apt exacerbate the problem," he said.  
  
In this context,no outdoor intervention can be advantageous in creating a
favorable environment for the Syrian-led inclusive political
process,[ferragamo 靴](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/products_new.html
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/products_new.html" ), which can be
conducted without violence and instability.  
  
The typical samples of alien interventions and prescriptions prevaricate
surrounded the forced regime adaptation among Syria and the arming of
civilians amid the country which has additionally been aboard the fringe of a
civil battle.  
  
There namely no one-size-for-all solution to the emergency among the West Asia
and North Africa, including Syria. In additional words, the nature of
grievances and national conditions vary from nation apt nation there can not
be one set of measures that can be applied apt always of them.  
  
"There is no doubt whatsoever that the Syrian authorities bear a big share of
responsibility as the new situation," Lavrov said at the committee meeting.
"But one ought not ignore the truth that a long duration now they've been
fighting never unarmed men,but combat units such as the so-called Free Syrian
Army and extremist groups including al-Qaida which have lately committed a
array of murderous terrorist acts"  
  
"The solutions of the problems in every country must take into consideration
the society's particular circumstances and the talent of its folk Puri said.
"However, what that certain that that solutions cannot include intervention
amongst naval force alternatively arming of the civilian population."  
  
"Such a lesson of action want only oil beyond bloodshed and instability and
create present marginalized groups the Russia alien minister said. "This also
risks propagating extremism and intolerance whose noxious consequences
aspiration be felt in the region and beyond."  
  
For his part Li likewise warned at the Security Council against the efforts to
move amongst regime alteration surrounded Syria and intervene amid the
internal businesses of the nation beneath the excuse of "
humanitarianism,accentuating that forever international activities concerned
should obey onward international decree and international humanitarian
judgment.  
  
On Saturday, Russia and the Arab League reached an agreement aboard a formula
of five points to determination the Syrian emergency including resisting
always foreign intervention.  
  
TOOL OF DIPLOMACY  
  
Right instantly the issue is not whether President Assad ought tread down,or
if the Syrian rebels should be armed with emigrant assistance The new altitude
priority should be the immediate ceasefire in Syria, from both sides -- the
government forces and armed rebels. To retention more lives within Syria
namely the top priority.  
  
At this moment, the intended approaches ought be matter-of-fact and feasible.
The immediate ceasefire among Syria, a altitude priority for the United
Nations,that an of them,[フェラガモ シャツ](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/%E3%83
%95%E3%82%A7%E3%83%A9%E3%82%AC%E3%83%A2-%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%83%84-c-1.html "

early blaze of political dialogue and unhindered humanitarian way to the
Syrians among absence.  
  
The Syrian-led inclusive political process ought begin among an environment
free of violence and bloodshed. That means the political reform ought be
conducted meanwhile social permanence and cohesion are maintained.  
  
The ceasefire can be achieved forward the tool of foreign affairs by the
elimination of the international community. Annan, the former UN secretary-
general, said ahead he departed the Syrian chief of Damascus that he remained
optimistic almost the feasibility of an approval surrounded Syria,barely
recognized the difficulties. "It's working to be difficult barely we have wish
he said.  
  
It namely hoped that the arduous mission by Annan, who enjoys full advocate
from the international community as his mediation efforts on
Syria,[クリスチャンルブタン](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), can support dilate some ideas that
are conducive apt an immediate annihilate apt violence and bloodshed among
Syria.

disburse off by an go as it requires unremitting efforts and lasting patience

##  News analysis London becoming intl RMB trade hub still a lon

by Wang Yahong &amp; Jiang Lurong  
  
LONDON, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- "Offshore trading," "Renminbi" and "China's
economic growth" were the words frequently listened at"City Week 2012," a
recent international forum on financial services held in London.  
  
During his visit apt China in January, British Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne pushed forward the development of the offshore RMB market and
announced plans apt create London into a major international trading centre
for RMB.  
  
The policy,1st launched last September during Chinese Vice Premier Wang
Qishan's visit apt Britain,[サルバトーレフェラガモ](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/
"http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/" ),is a advisable fancy barely has a
long and complicated lesson to go.  
  
BRIGHT PROSPECT  
  
With the endless quantitative easing policy of the U.S.ministry after the
breakout of the financial emergency in 2008, investors have suffered a lot
from the depreciation of U.S.USD hoping the market can decrease reliance
aboard the greenpaper.  
  
Meanwhile,[クリスチャンルブタン](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ), the debt emergency in Europe has
made the euro,[ルブタン](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), the world's another major keep
currency, go powerless.  
  
"The Renminbi, as a chief currency, has the greatest potential to transformed
the third international currency," said Professor Kate Phylaktis from Cass
Business School in London.  
  
HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver prophesied RMB ambition transformed one
of the world's three bishop keep currencies among 15-20 years as the
U.S.dollar loses its clutch with investors.  
  
Noting rapid growth in offshore RMB accounts in Hong Kong since China easeful
controls last yearly Gulliver said, "We may be at the fringe of a financial
revolution."  
  
China's central bank has been working hard apt internationalize its currency
as a pair of years, implementing pilot schemes apt dilate RMB markets signing
currency barter agreements with additional countries, as well as negotiating
abroad loans denominated in RMB.  
  
Li Jiange,[christian louboutin online](http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanheels.com/" ), Chairman of China International
Capital Corporation Limited (CICC), said, "We need to be convertible sooner
rather than after The benefits are apparent I think we should speed it up."  
  
London, as the largest foreign-exchange trading hub in the world,longing
behalf a lot from RMB trading.  
  
It would acknowledge private banks and wealth managers to invest in the
rapidly appreciating Chinese currency aboard behalf of their consumers without
needing a physical base in Asia.  
  
British banks and financial service institutions increasingly absence apt
trade in the RMB, seeing this as a rapidly growing mall in emigrant exchange
and bond issuance, said British Treasury officials. As matter of fact,many
private banks, including Barclays Wealth, DBS, HSBC Private Bank, OCBC, are
yet attempting RMB products and services.  
  
For Britain, it will give a increase either to happening and jobs in the City
and to the honor of London as a prevalent financial center.  
  
In addition, it will send some comfort to international bankers based in
London,many of whom were worried that the Britain's position in the unattended
market -- which they mention is the main reason they go in the City -- could
be put at risk along Prime Minister David Cameron's decision apt deny
amendments apt the EU treaty.  
  
What may matter most in a universal context,is that this would be watched as a
beyond step aboard the road towards abatement of China's control of the RMB
amount and aboard chief flows.  
  
LONG WAY TO GO  
  
Although Osborne, the City and some bank giants have drawn a rosy image for
London to chanced an international hub of RMB trading, the access before still
remains long and complicated, because some of the problems are complex apt
solve in approximate term.  
  
China and Britain have never signed currency swap approval and likewise a full
internationalization of RMB namely essential.  
  
A full convertibility of RMB aspiration be a gradual and a long process,
demanding a mature and developed financial system, which permits open-up to
central inflows and allows domestic investors apt bring money abroad.  
  
Good newspaper as London namely that since 2009, China has been gradually
relaxing restrictions aboard the currency,allowing companies apt use RMB to
bench cross-border trades and apt bombard investment productions in RMB.  
  
London ambition go hard to contend with Hong Kong, even with Singapore as the
offshore centre If Beijing chooses London, it can not only win the euro-dollar
experience,only likewise 24-hour universal currency trading opportunities.  
  
Xia Bin, an coach to China's central bank,deemed in the short term, London
could position itself as a preeminent RMB trading heart as Europe.  
  
"In three apt five years,whether London works hard, it want be the offshore
trading center for European purchasers meanwhile Hong Kong will service Asian
buyers he said.  
  
Though not formal plans have been announced additionally officials have
confirmed that China was seeing apt construct a third offshore RMB removing
bank except those in Hong Kong and Macao. Having a removing bank apt movement
the functions of a local offshore central bank namely a key prerequisite as
starting a deliverable currency mall.  
  
The RMB has apt be held according additional countries as foreigner exchange
reserves and adapt by international markets as an investment currency to
realize real internationalization, a process which the RMB has not
additionally started The realization of RMB internationalization longing
greatly rely aboard China's economic power, and the U.S.USD has spent decades
to complete the journey.  
  
As the RMB is still not completely convertible, the tarn of redback deposits
in London that finite The size alternatively liquidity of the RMB is still
very small,[フェラガモ 通販](http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_all.html
"http://www.ferragamotokyo.com/products_all.html" ), setting limits aboard how
much can be transacted emerge from.  
  
RMB offshore hub can't be built in an day merely the long and complicated road
leads to a bright prospect. The RMB would be on its way apt becoming a fitting
globally-traded currency, commensurate with China's status as the world's
second biggest economy. Related articles：

##  More Chinese younger migrant workers hope to settle in citie

QINGDAO, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) -- Different from their parents, who afterward
working among cities would return household apt rustic China with their
savings, the current generation of migrant workers often choose to bench down
in the bustling hubs where they work.  
  
Migrant hireling Zhao Bin from Pingyin shire among east China's Shandong
Province returned apt Qingdao, a coastal metropolis where he and his wife had
worked as nine years, shortly next the Spring Festival holiday,[paul

"I'm planning apt bench down amid this metropolis so I come behind to go on
phase so that I can make more money and hopefully purchase a house here in the

Zhao and his wife both go as tailors among a garment factory, Jifa Group,
where they can earn nearly seven,[ポールスミス

month.  
  
Their company also attempts them a free suite And unlike their parents'
generation, they can afford to bring their infant to the metropolis for
education.  
  
"We acclimate apt abandon our job at the annual annihilate and find a current
an then Spring Festival. But instantly we feel much like those long-term
employees among the company," Zhao said.  
  
China's shrinking labor force,prejudiced as a sequel of the one-child
policy,[フェラガモ トート](http://www.ferragamojapanonline.com/

salaries and offer better working conditions for migrant workers.

However, making their way among the enormous cities namely never easy as these
current comers. Education and health attention are never cheap and apartment
costs are absurdly expensive likened to the mean wage surrounded the country's
metropolitan zones.  
  
"Unlike the rustic life that that easy and self-sufficient,[Timberland Boots

cities for we must disburse our housing and always daily necessities," said Wu

apt disburse almost 5,000 yuan every semester. The amount that the largest
consumption for the home.  
  
"It is worthwhile for education among our rural hometown is not as agreeable
as here surrounded Shenzhen," Wu said.  
  
Apart from the better educational environment for their children,to live amid
cities likewise means more training opportunities for migrant workers.  
  
Among the 2,500 young migrant workers surveyed by the CFCRI, 38.six percent
said they wished apt earn some technical know-how meanwhile 19.six percent
expressed their willingness to become technical workers.  
  
Zhu Guangtian and his two brothers,all from Shandong's rustic county of Yinan,
have worked for Qingdao Port Group for 12 years. All of them have purchased
their own houses and settled down among the coastal metropolis.  
  
"We receive technical training approximately each day amid our go and what we
have academic has qualified us to live a better-off life today," Zhu said.  
  
"Migrant workers trying apt bench down in the cities ought be given more
consideration as they are the main force of Chinese urbanization," said Li
Wei, a researcher at the Qingdao Academy of Social Sciences.  
  
China's urban population has outnumbered rustic dwellers by the kill of
2011,[ルブタン 価格](http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/
"http://www.louboutinsjapanvogue.com/" ), with 690.79 million alternatively

Under this background the Chinese ministry ought likewise disburse more
attention apt the coordinated evolution of urban and rural regions as

migrant workers, leaving the elderly and the women behind at the rustic
villages, Li said. Related articles：
