A **FIRST robotics team** consists of high school
[students](/index.php/Students "Students" ), [mentors](/index.php/Mentors
"Mentors" ), and [teachers](/index.php/Teachers "Teachers" ) working together
to compete in the [FIRST Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ).

Mentors are at the heart of any FIRST team--mentors are responsible for
inspiring the students. But the students must work together with the
community, striving to inspire younger children and adults alike in science
and technology. In this regard, a FIRST team is not like the typical sports
team or school organization. Teams strive to achieve the goals of FIRST,
follow the [FIRST philosophy](/index.php/FIRST_philosophy "FIRST philosophy"
), and be [gracious professionals](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism
"Gracious professionalism" ) in all that they do.
