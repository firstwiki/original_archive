**FIRST Overdrive** is the 2008 game for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](first-robotics-competition), announced on January 5, 2008\.

In Overdrive, teams race around the field and compete to complete counterclockwise laps around a central barrier while manipulating large 40-inch (1 m) diameter "Trackballs" over and under overpasses to score additional points.

An archive of the game rules can be found on the FIRST website [2008 FRC Manual and Related Documents](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/content.aspx?id=9152 "http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/content.aspx?id=9152")

## Game Overview

FIRST Overdrive is played on a 54 foot × 27 foot (16 m × 8 m) track divided lengthwise by a lane divider which divides the field into a Red side and a Blue side. The lane divider is crossed by a 6 1/2 foot tall overpass marking the red and blue finish lines. Two three-team alliances race around the track in a counter clockwise direction manipulating their alliance's Trackballs.

The game is made up of two scoring periods. The first 15 seconds of play is the Hybrid period in which robots are autonomous, and may also respond to digital signals sent by team Robocoaches stationed at the corners of the track.

The next two minutes of play is the Teleoperated period. At this time, robots are radio controlled by team operators standing at either end of the field.

### Scoring

During the Hybrid period, robots traveling in a counter clockwise direction score:

- 8 points for each of their Trackballs knocked off of the overpass
- 8 points for each of their Trackballs passed over the overpass
- 4 points whenever their robot crosses a lane marker
- 4 points whenever their robot crosses their opponent's finish line
- 4 points whenever their robot crosses their finish line
- 2 points whenever their trackball crosses their finish line

During the Teleoperated period, robots traveling in a counter clockwise direction score:

- 2 points whenever their robot crosses their finish line
- 2 points whenever their Trackball crosses its finish line by itself
- 8 points whenever their Trackball hurdles its overpass

Alliances score an additional 12 points for each of their Trackballs that are positioned anywhere on the overpass at the end of the match.

### Hybrid Period

Hybrid period is a new addition to an FRC game. Rather than the pre-game autonomous modes of previous years where robots were prohibited from receiving input from humans, robots may receive signals via an infrared (IR) remote control from a designated Robocoach during the Hybrid period.

The number of different IR signals the IR board is physically able to receive is 4\. The number of distinct commands that are allowed to be sent is also 4, thus ruling out multi-signal combinations.

## Robots

FIRST overdrive challenged many teams to score points utilizing the large ball game pieces. The result was a mixed pool of robots that managed to score points using the balls in different ways.

- **"Lifters"** were the most straight forward robots which utilized either an arm or lifting device to lift the ball over the overpass.
- **"Pushers"** were one of the more common robot types. These robots scored by pushing the balls around the track. These robots could also score more points by simply going in circles around the track at high speed, earning points with each lap.
- **"Shooters"** were one of the least common, yet most successful, robot types. Many teams considered the possibility of shooting the game pieces over the overpass, but they had thought that it would be a difficult task to accomplish due to the large game pieces and height of the overpass. However, many teams did successfully build robots which could score over the overpass by shooting the balls over it. The speed at which these robots could score was unmatched by most other types of robots, making them some of the most successful of the season.
