## Renaming this article

Does anyone else think that this article should be renamed either City Sights or City Sights (FLL)? I think of of those is more suitable, since all the FRC game pages are named after the game (ex. Aim High, Triple Play, etc) and not FRC Competition 2002.

```
I agree. I'm not going to append the FLL though. At the moment there is no overlap in game names - and it seems unlikely that there will be in the future. I'll go ahead and make that change for all the FLL Challenge pages currently created (I've only finished from 2002 on). 

Still need to finish the older ones. Ideally I'd like to "beef" them up a bit. I know on the FRC game pages they use graphics from the FIRST site that are related to the game. Do you think I can do that for the FLL stuff too? Would probably make the pages a bit more engaging. -[PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll" ) 17:35, 15 February 2006 (EST)
