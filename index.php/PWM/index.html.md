**PWM** stands for _**Pulse Width Modulation**_. A PWM signal is a square wave that transmits data by varying the widht of the signal, or time which it is high, creating an <analog> signal with limits, so to speak (any value between 0 and 1 inclusively). By varying the width of the signal, the [speed controller](Speed_controller "Speed controller") can make changes to the speed the [motors](Motor "Motor") are run at.
