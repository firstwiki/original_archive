Engineering/Robot" )]

###  Engineering/Robot

Information about the HOT Team's Engineering/Robot Group can be found on Team
67's [Engineering](http://www2.huronvalley.k12.mi.us/schools/mhs/activity/hot_
team/HOT_ENGINEERING.HTM "http://www2.huronvalley.k12.mi.us/schools/mhs/activi

)]

###  Chairman's

In 2005 the HOT Team received the Chairman's Award.

In the fall of 2004, the HOT Team's Chairman's group tasked the Engineering
group to create CASEY (Community Awareness in Science and Engineering Year-
round). CASEY is a shobot, a robot other than the competition robot, that the
team can take around the community and entertain with. CASEY is designed
simply so young children can operate it safely.

Outside of creating the [Chairman's Award](/index.php/Chairman%27s_Award
"Chairman's Award" ) Submission, this group keeps track of the team's progress
through newsletters, photographs, and videos. They also help promote HOT in
the community by involving the team in such things as an adopt a road program
and the Huron River clean-up.

/hot_team/hot_chairmans.htm" ) page.


###  Animation

The purpose of the group each year is to create a 30 second animation
displaying what [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) means to the team.

Every year, the team mades a very competitive animation and masters the
complicated aspects of [3D Studio Max](/index.php/3D_Studio_Max "3D Studio
Max" ).
