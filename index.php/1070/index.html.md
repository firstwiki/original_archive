## History

Louisville High School's FIRST Robotics Team, the Royal Robotrons, began in
2001. They had worked very closely with and were mentored by Team
[599](/index.php/599 "599" ), the Robodox. The team has participated in the
Southern California Regionals since then. In 2005, the Robotrons placed in the
quarter-finals at the Arizona FRC regional and in the semi-finals at the Los
Angeles FRC regional. In 2006, the Royal Robotrons participated in the
Southern California FIRST VEX Challenge. In the 2007 FRC season, the Robotrons
mentored with Reseda High's VEX team 3536, who are also now participating in
the FRC competition. This year, the Royal Robotrons mentroed a home-schooled
student, Jimmy Centiorino.

Last season in 2007, the Robotrons participated in the Los Angeles Regional
and the Silicon Valley Regional. At LA, the Robotrons were the #1 seeded team
and made it into the quarter finals with Team 968 RAWC and Team 599 Robodox.
At Silicon Valley, the Robotrons were seated #4 and again, made it into
quarter-finals with the Cheesy Poofs and Fembots.
