FIRST in Michigan was a Pilot Program to test FIRST's new Competition
structure. Founded in 2009 to make FIRST cheaper and easier to compete for not
only new team but veterans as well. FIRST in Michiganis a District structure
event with Districts competitions that lead to a State Championship that then
lead to the World Championship. In 2009 their were only 7 District events and
1 state championship:

7 District Events (Traverse City, Kettering University, Cass Tech, Detroit,
Lansing, Troy, West Michigan) 1 State Championship (Eastern Michigan
University)

For $5000, teams sign up for two district events, which are equivalent to
regional competitions run on a lower budget. In addition, 64 teams qualify to
compete in the state championship. With so many districts within the state
teams get to play more often and closer to home, reducing the cost of travel
and lodging. Furthermore, teams do not have to pay shipping because a lock-up
system is used to store robots in between competitions.

This year we are up to 10 District events (Kettering University, Gull Lake,
Traverse City, Waterford, West Michigan, Detroit, Nile, Northville, Livonia,
Troy) leading into the Michigan State Championship at Eastern Michigan
University.
