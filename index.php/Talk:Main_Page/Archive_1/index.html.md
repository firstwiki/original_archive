## Uploading images

I can't upload an images. The upload page says "The upload directory
(/data/wiki/public_html/media) is not writable by the webserver." This appears
to be an integral feature of the site. [Kamocat](User:Kamocat
"User:Kamocat" ) 02:00, 23 July 2010 (EDT)

  * You will probably want to post this in the FirstWiki section of the ChiefDeplhi forums, I doubt it will get the necessary attention from the admins that control the server here. I agree though, this is an important feature that needs to get fixed. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 14:08, 23 July 2010 (EDT)

##  Editing problems

Recently for some reason or another I have been having problems editing
certain pages on this site. I'll go into the edit menu, make some changes and
after I click submit it will then send me to another edit menu only it is a
completely blank page. No fields or any other sort of information. At the end
of the URL on all of these pages is "&amp;action=submit". I'm assuming that
this is supposed to be some sort of automated page that would normally forward
you back to the page being edited but doesn't.

See
[[1]](http://wiki.chiefdelphi.comImage:FIRSTWiki_edit_glitch.jpg
"http://wiki.chiefdelphi.comImage:FIRSTWiki_edit_glitch.jpg" ) for
a screenshot of the issue.

Any thoughts? [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 13:15,

I am having issues editing my team's page (151) as well, I need to update a
table and the only way of getting there is to edit the entire page, but when i
do this it just blanks the page when I hit save. It's really annoying.

    The issues is now known as the editing glitch. There are many pages around the site that have this problem, eventually we plan on finding someone who can fix the issue. The problem seems to be limited to the main edit button, so unfortunately this means no table changes untill it gets fixed or another user who is not experiencing the issue can edit it. 

    Please report any occurances of this glitch at the following page: [FIRSTwiki:Uneditable_Articles](FIRSTwiki:Uneditable_Articles "FIRSTwiki:Uneditable Articles" ). Thanks. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 19:20, 26 February 2008 (EST) 

    

     Will upgrading to the newest version of MediaWiki (version 1.11.x) solve this problem? Here's our [current version](Special:Version "Special:Version" ). [Nlaverdure](User:Nlaverdure "User:Nlaverdure" ) 13:02, 27 February 2008 (EST) 

    

    

     Wow, we are a few versions behind aren't we? Guess it wouldn't hurt, assuming we're not going to loose pages or anything like that. Of course who we would need to contact to actually update it is beyond me. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 23:36, 27 February 2008 (EST) 

    

    

    

     [Upgrading to Mediawiki 1.11](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading "http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Upgrading" ). Looks like we'll need access to the site at the server level.

I have the same problem, and I have found that it's a limit on the characters.
I tried adding a bit of my team's page one at a time, and it wouldn't let me
save the last little bit. That means there is a limit of characters you can
use. What I did was split my team's page in half, put the two halves on
different pages on my userpage ([User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st
half](User:MindstormsKid/Team_page_1st_half
"User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st half" ) and [User:MindstormsKid/Team page
2nd half](User:MindstormsKid/Team_page_2nd_half
"User:MindstormsKid/Team page 2nd half" )). I then put the following on my
team's page:

    
    
     {{FLLteamtable|
     |name=Team Terastorm
     |color=blue
     |image=[[Image:TeamTerastorm.jpg|314px|Team logo]]
     |yearfounded=2007
     |organization=Chattanooga Engineers Club
     |city=Chattanooga
     |stateorcountry=Tennessee
     |website=[http://teamterastorm.googlepages.com/ Team website]
     }}
     {{User:MindstormsKid/Team page 1st half}}
     {{User:MindstormsKid/Team page 2nd half}}
    
    

It worked. Note: **Be sure to put the FLLteamtable template ON THE ARTICLE
PAGE, _not_ a different page.** [MindstormsKid](User:MindstormsKid
"User:MindstormsKid" ) 13:56, 15 March 2008 (EDT)

It isn't necessarily a character limit, some pages have very little content
and still have this problem. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000
"User:Cbale2000" ) 16:42, 17 March 2008 (EDT)

##  Vandalism and more Vandalism

Just got done fixing some Vandalism from
[88.226.134.138](User:88.226.134.138 "User:88.226.134.138" )

I don't really understand the logic behind "hacking" a wiki that anyone can
edit. Sounds like something an 8 year old would do to get a few laughs to me.
I doubt whoever keeps doing this will see this or care, but what the heck.
[Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 16:55, 2 March 2007

Well, yet more Vandalism from [85.103.149.187](User:85.103.149.187
"User:85.103.149.187" ) this time. Can someone block these guys or something?
This is ridicules. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" )

More Vandalism from [85.99.29.44](User:85.99.29.44
"User:85.99.29.44" ) this time. Are there any Admins on this site anymore?
This is out of control. **To the Hackers:** You know, is clearing out ONE talk
page on an underused Wiki really worth the effort? Especially since I just
revert it the next day! If you really have that much time on your hand go get
a job or something; you're only wasting everyone else's time.

[[edit](/index.php?title=Talk:Main_Page/Archive_1&action=edit&section=4 "Edit
section: Featured article incorrect" )]

##  Featured article incorrect

I would just like to point out that the information on the Featured Article
page is incorrect. It says [Taurus (1073)](Taurus_%281073%29
"Taurus \(1073\)" ) was from the game FIRST Frenzy: Raising the Bar but
clearly shows an image of a robot from Triple Play and the Taurus article
agrees. I'd change it myself but I don't know how or even if I can. If someone
would inform me on how to (again, if regular members have permissions to do
so) I would gladly update the Featured Article section myself (and even change
it once in a while to show some variety).

##  lamers

Someone seems to have gone and deleted all the articles that are important,
the index of people for example and the community portal there are several
hundred pages by several very similar ips in a few minutes, all over anyone
able to revert stuff please? And it seems that anything that has a few top
level links seems to have had it happen to such as the hitchhikers guide to
robotics. even this page sad people

  * Man I'm disappointed in the admins here. The vandalism/spam I removed was on the site for over two months. --[141.212.50.143](User:141.212.50.143 "User:141.212.50.143" ) 00:15, 13 December 2005 (EST) (SirNuke [Wikipedia User Page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SirNuke "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SirNuke" ), former 1014 member) 

    I'm offended! I've been working my tail off trying to keep the spam out. And frankly, just the new stuff is enough to keep me busy. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 07:57, 13 December 2005 (EST)

section: featured article" )]

##  featured article

Please update the main page... The same featured page for two years is getting
old ;). If there are no newer pages that are interesting enough to be featured
we have failed as wikipedians.

    Any suggestions? --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 00:08, 5 January 2006 (EST) 

Text in the area where the featured article would be doesn't even make
sense... "Recommend and article!" WTH? This site needs new management. Nothing
seems to of been updated for nearly a year now. The logo is old and ugly..
just seems like everyone is generally lazy. --[Hobo](User:Hobo
"User:Hobo" ) 11:20, 15 January 2006 (EST)

    There really is no management to blame. I am the leader of this project, and there are 6 other sysops (of which maybe 2 are still active) but we don't really exert any great control over what happens. There is only so much effort we can put into it and there is absolutely no way "the management", in their spare time, alone can create a website that will hopefully swell to 5000+ pages. So, if you are disappointed with it, get more people involved. If you are disappointed with a particular part of the site, take it on as your duty to be "Curator of Featured Articles". Regardless, thanks for your contributions so far, and I hope to see you and team mates editing more in the future. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](1257 "1257" )] 13:34, 15 January 2006 (EST) 

    If you don't like the logo, we can go back to the [old one](Image:Logo_temporary.png "Image:Logo temporary.png" ). ;) This is a wiki. If you don't like something, fix it. If it lacks something, add it. If you see spam, remove it. If you see misinformation, change it. [Be bold!](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BB "wikipedia:WP:BB" ) \--[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 15:23, 15 January 2006 (EST) 

    Ehh... sorry for ranting before as I was upset for various reasons... I apologize to the management as I just simply haven't seen this site change at all in a year. Perhaps just frustrating that everyone spends time on CD instead of here ;). Anyway, I would be happy to design a new logo, but with all the rules that FIRST has with usage I highly doubt we would be able to get it approved. Anyway, sorry about before, and I wish you all the best of luck this season. --[Hobo](User:Hobo "User:Hobo" ) 17:07, 25 January 2006 (EST) 

  * I updated the Featured Article because no one else has done anything to the site and I'm trying to get the main page to look right. If there is a problem with this, feel free to take it down. - [Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" ) 11:12, 11 July 2006 (EDT)

## New Design

I don't know how many people read this or visit the site, but the main page
could use some work. I have experience with wiki formatting and I'd like to
help improve it, but it's locked. -[Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138
"User:Hollis1138" ) 13:50, 28 June 2006 (EDT)

  * I've done a lot of work lately on my prototype new front page, please look at it [HERE](User:Hollis1138/Front_page_development "User:Hollis1138/Front page development" ). Perhaps we can replace the existing page with the one I've made or at least with parts from it. Let me know what you think, thanks. - [Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" ) 14:42, 7 July 2006 (EDT) 
  * To be honest, I think there are some things that need change with the new design. It doesn't seem to have any logic to it. There is a section called "navigation" yet 2 other sections certainly fall under that category and they are not grouped together. Additionally, Removing the color differences made it harder to quickly find things on the page. I do like the new header though. It is certainly clearer, but I think we should revert the rest of the page unless you have something better. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](1257 "1257" )] 17:15, 11 July 2006 (EDT) 
  * Sure, do whatever you think is best. - [Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" ) 09:42, 12 July 2006 (EDT) 
    * I reverted back to the previous version but the new header, how does that look? - [Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" ) 14:08, 12 July 2006 (EDT) 
    * I like it better like this. I wasn't saying that you had to revert it. I don't want to be the "boss" of the website even if I do hold the keys, so to speak. I was just stating my opinion. But, yes, I do prefer it this way. I'm thinking about putting navigation above the featured article or something like that? What about the message at the bottom? should we incorporate into the top one? The part about community info seems pretty relevant. 
      * I think putting the navigation above the featured article is a good idea, but I also think it should be reorganized to be more concise and _aesthetically pleasing_. I can incorporate the bottom part of the main page into the header too. Please feel free to look at / edit the [development front page](User:Hollis1138/Front_page_development "User:Hollis1138/Front page development" ). - [Hollis1138](User:Hollis1138 "User:Hollis1138" ) 10:33, 13 July 2006 (EDT) 
        * I've made my own design, based on Wikipedia's. It's [User:MindstormsKid/Main Page](User:MindstormsKid/Main_Page "User:MindstormsKid/Main Page" ). It's more compact, and has a lot less things than the version now. I think it needs some more, but I can't figure out where. 
          * Well this is sort of a dead topic so I don't think you're going to get very far with it. I personally like the current setup as it assists in navigating to some of the most important FIRST topics. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 15:35, 19 July 2008 (EDT)
