# Rotary actuator

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A **rotary actuator** is a [pneumatics](/index.php/Pneumatics "Pneumatics" )
component used to turn air pressure into rotational energy. The ones used by
[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) are manufactured by
[Bimba](http://www.bimba.com "http://www.bimba.com" ).


## Connections


### Air

Brass fittings can be connected onto both ends to apply pressure to the
actuator.


### Load

The shaft is 0.375" x 1.000" and uses a 0.0625" x 0.032" woodruff key. The
actuator can be secured using two 10-32 bolts on the base.
