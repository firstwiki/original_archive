# Rotary actuator

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A **rotary actuator** is a [pneumatics](Pneumatics "Pneumatics") component used to turn air pressure into rotational energy. The ones used by [FIRST](first) are manufactured by [Bimba](http://www.bimba.com "http://www.bimba.com").

## Connections

### Air

Brass fittings can be connected onto both ends to apply pressure to the actuator.

### Load

The shaft is 0.375" x 1.000" and uses a 0.0625" x 0.032" woodruff key. The actuator can be secured using two 10-32 bolts on the base.
