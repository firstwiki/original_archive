The FLL Challenge theme for 2002 was City Sights. FLL teams were tasked to compete in the Robot Game, as well complete a Research Assignment to design a solution using robotics technology to a problem faced by a City of their choice.

The challenge was released in September, 2002 with the bulk of Official State tournaments occuring in December. The season was concluded by the [FLL Invitational](FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival") (now known as the FLL World Festival) which was held in conjunction with the FIRST Championship event in April 2003.

## Robot Game

The robot game is played on 8 foot x 4 foot board. It had models made out of Lego on it related to that year's theme. Examples included: Fixing a Bridge; Collecting and Distributing Food; Cleaning up a Soccer Field; Cleaning up Toxic Waste; etc. These were all missions that might need to be done to support a city environment. In the robot game, a robot designed by the team and built entirely from Lego Mindstorms kits and Lego pieces had to autonomously complete the missions on the board. Each mission had a specific point value.

## The Project

The Research Assignment for City Sights asked teams to...

- Pick one of a selected number of Cities (or teams could choose their own city)
- Research that city to determine problems that city faces
- Design a solution using robotics technology to solve the problem
- Create a cool presentation and be prepared to present it to the judges at the tournament
