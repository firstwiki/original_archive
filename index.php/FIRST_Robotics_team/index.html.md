A **FIRST robotics team** consists of high school [students](Students "Students"), [mentors](Mentors "Mentors"), and [teachers](Teachers "Teachers") working together to compete in the [FIRST Robotics Competition](first).

Mentors are at the heart of any FIRST team--mentors are responsible for inspiring the students. But the students must work together with the community, striving to inspire younger children and adults alike in science and technology. In this regard, a FIRST team is not like the typical sports team or school organization. Teams strive to achieve the goals of FIRST, follow the [FIRST philosophy](FIRST_philosophy "FIRST philosophy"), and be [gracious professionals](Gracious_professionalism "Gracious professionalism") in all that they do.
