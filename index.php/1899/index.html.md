## History

**This history needs to be split into seperate articles.**   
This section should be for general history, such as formation, general growth,
etc.  
Expanded yearly history should go into a team-year artical, see the
[formats](FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) page
for help.

### 2005-2006

Formed in late 2005, Saints Robotics participated in the 2006 game [Aim
High](aim-high). It was funded exclusively by the NASA
grant for [rookie teams](Rookie_teams "Rookie teams" ). Saints
Robotics initially [seeded](Seed "Seed" ) 36 out of 45 competitors
at the [Pacific Northwest Regional](Pacific_Northwest_Regional
"Pacific Northwest Regional" ), with only three members attending the
competition in Portland, Oregon, but managed to place 35th overall.

The 2006 robot was plagued by multiple problems. It was not named until mid-
January 2007, when it was christened "Nubcake" as its electronics and custom
drive gearbox were being dismantled for experimental purposes. While it had no
problem overcoming the 30 degree incline, about a third of the matches on the
drive chains would come off, and Nubcake would become stuck on the field. Its
[autonomous mode](Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ) was a simple
"drive, turn, drive, dump," written on-site at the competition.


### 2006-2007

Saints Robotics' entry into the competition was funded by the Bezos Family
Foundation. The [team](Team "Team" ) consisted primarily of
underclassmen, with only two juniors and one senior member. Luckily, the
inclusion of an extended gifted program into Interlake had and will continue
to bring great potential into the program. However, the most experienced
members of the team had only been a part of [FIRST](first)
for their second year, meaning a severe lack of experience. Much progress
occurred despite not having had organized a pre-season, including the
establishment of a functional website, active public relations efforts,
augmented recruitment, and a relatively smooth [build
season](Build_season "Build season" ). Team 1899 eventually managed
to make ends meet, arranging [regional](Regional "Regional" )
competition travel plans and team uniforms at the last minute.

During the regionals, the team preformed better than expected. Although they
lost the first few rounds due to problems with the chains and the claw, they
managed to win three matches. Their best win was 49 to 2. They drove up
multiple ramps and hung up multiple ringers. They ended up placing 39th.


### 2007-2008

The team has commenced operations early in the school year in an effort to
acquire funding and other resources before the build season.
