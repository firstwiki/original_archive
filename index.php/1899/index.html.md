### 2005-2006

Formed in late 2005, Saints Robotics participated in the 2006 game [Aim High](aim-high). It was funded exclusively by the NASA grant for [rookie teams](Rookie_teams "Rookie teams"). Saints Robotics initially [seeded](Seed "Seed") 36 out of 45 competitors at the [Pacific Northwest Regional](Pacific_Northwest_Regional "Pacific Northwest Regional"), with only three members attending the competition in Portland, Oregon, but managed to place 35th overall.

The 2006 robot was plagued by multiple problems. It was not named until mid- January 2007, when it was christened "Nubcake" as its electronics and custom drive gearbox were being dismantled for experimental purposes. While it had no problem overcoming the 30 degree incline, about a third of the matches on the drive chains would come off, and Nubcake would become stuck on the field. Its [autonomous mode](autonomous-mode) was a simple "drive, turn, drive, dump," written on-site at the competition.

### 2006-2007

Saints Robotics' entry into the competition was funded by the Bezos Family Foundation. The [team](team) consisted primarily of underclassmen, with only two juniors and one senior member. Luckily, the inclusion of an extended gifted program into Interlake had and will continue to bring great potential into the program. However, the most experienced members of the team had only been a part of [FIRST](first) for their second year, meaning a severe lack of experience. Much progress occurred despite not having had organized a pre-season, including the establishment of a functional website, active public relations efforts, augmented recruitment, and a relatively smooth [build season](Build_season "Build season"). Team 1899 eventually managed to make ends meet, arranging [regional](Regional "Regional") competition travel plans and team uniforms at the last minute.

During the regionals, the team preformed better than expected. Although they lost the first few rounds due to problems with the chains and the claw, they managed to win three matches. Their best win was 49 to 2\. They drove up multiple ramps and hung up multiple ringers. They ended up placing 39th.

### 2007-2008

The team has commenced operations early in the school year in an effort to acquire funding and other resources before the build season.
