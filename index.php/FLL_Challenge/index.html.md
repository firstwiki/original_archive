Each year the [FIRST LEGO League](FIRST_LEGO_League "FIRST LEGO
League") issues a challenge to the FLL community. This challenge is always of scientific or topical interest and always around robotics, science and technology.

The challenge will include of course the Robot Game challenging FLL teams to create a robot out of [LEGO Mindstorms](LEGO_Mindstorms "LEGO
Mindstorms") kits and other LEGO parts. It will also include a research presentation or topic with formal presentation to the judges. Teams attend FLL Events where they can compete with their peers and share what they've learned.
