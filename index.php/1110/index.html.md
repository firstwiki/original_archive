## History

Team 1110, the Binary Bulldogs, is a team from Highland High School in
Palmdale, California. We are currently a third year team and compete at the
[Southern California Regional](/index.php/Southern_California_Regional
"Southern California Regional" ). The Binary Bulldogs were started in 2003
with seven members, but we extended our program to seventenen in 2004. We have
also upgraded our performance at competition, from 40th place at the [Southern
California Regional](/index.php/Southern_California_Regional "Southern
California Regional" ) in 2003 to 28th place in 2004. In 2005 we will attend
the regional in Las Vegas due to a request from [NASA](/index.php/NASA "NASA"
) one of our sponsors.
