Videography is the recording of video onto electric media, such as
[dvd](/index.php?title=Dvd&action=edit "Dvd" ). A videographer may be the
person actually operating the camera or he or she may be the person in charge
of the visual design of a production. In FIRST, videography plays a big role,
especially because many of the people who like robots are adept at
videography, or as some say, videotaping. Video is one of the main ways FIRST
gets advertised, for free. This is the reason that FIRST is so helpful with
media passes and such. These photos find thier ways onto the internet, where
FIRST is advertised, for free.
