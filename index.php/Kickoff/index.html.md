The kickoff is [FIRST](first)'s chance to reveal the
season's new [FIRST Robotics
Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ) [game](Game "Game" ). The actual kickoff is held in
Manchester, NH at a location near [FIRST
headquarters](FIRST_headquarters "FIRST headquarters" ), but remote
kickoffs are held all around the country so [team](Team "Team" )
members can attend local broadcasts and learn about the new game from the
mouths of the people who came up with it. FIRST celebrities like [Dean
Kamen](Dean_Kamen "Dean Kamen" ) and [Woodie
Flowers](Woodie_Flowers "Woodie Flowers" ) announce new features of
the competition and stress the importance of [gracious
professionalism](Gracious_professionalism "Gracious
professionalism" ). A demonstration of the new game is also sometimes done,
and a model of that year's field is unveiled. Then, each team is given their
kit of parts, which has earned kickoff the nickname of a FIRSTer's Christmas.
