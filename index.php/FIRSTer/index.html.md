FIRSTers is generally defined as those who are involved in
[FIRST](first).


## Characteristics

FIRSTers tend to be helpful to others, oftentimes significantly going out of
their way to help other teams in need. Although there is a certain stereotype
that FIRSTers tend to be geeks (interested and knowledgeable in technology,
such as computers and, of course, robotics), many of the roles in a
[team](Team "Team" ) are non-technical. There is a diverse flavor
of people, however, so all cannot be classified together. Still, certain
generalizations can be made.
