Well, torque can also be described as force times moment arm (in the odd case that you don't appreciate vector calculus). I'm thinking that maybe an example of a motor's torque (with link to motor page), and a more detailed explanation of why it is important if you are building a robot is in order. Also, see [Wikipedia:Torque](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "wikipedia:Torque"). Any takers? --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 16:34, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
