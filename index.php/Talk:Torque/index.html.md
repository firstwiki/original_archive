Well, torque can also be described as force times moment arm (in the odd case
that you don't appreciate vector calculus). I'm thinking that maybe an example
of a motor's torque (with link to motor page), and a more detailed explanation
of why it is important if you are building a robot is in order. Also, see
[Wikipedia:Torque](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque "wikipedia:Torque" ).
Any takers? --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 16:34, 9 Jun
