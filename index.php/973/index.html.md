## History

973 was started in 2002 by a high school student, with strong contributions
from the Greybots' 2002-06 lead mentor, and school physics teacher, John
Miron.

In 2007, John Miron passed down the role to Larry Price, a senior engineer at
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant.

In 2008, Adam Heard, an alumnus from team 294 started his college career at
Cal Poly San Luis. His past expirence helped guide 973 into what it is today.
2008 was the first year that 973 advanced into the finals at any competition.

In 2009, 973 built for the first time two robots. This prooved to be a good
move when 973 rolled away from the Los Angeles regional with its first victory
ever. While attending Championships 973's robot Raptor had the highest OPR
rating out of all robots attending, but was eliminated in the semifinals of
Galileo.

In 2011, Larry Price stepped down and gave the lead mentor role to Adam Heard.
This was the first year that 973 joined forces with another team, 1323. With
the help of team 1323, 973 was able to have a complete robot frame made
intirely out of aluminum, including the belly-pan. While attending the San
Diego and Los Angeles regionals, 973 was rewarded with its first judged awards
in 6 years, the first time 973 had ever recieved more than 1 award in a
season. At champs 973 teamed up with 254 and 111 to create the dream alliance.
Both 254 and 111 were capable of hanging an average of 8 tubes per match,
while 973's minibot was proven to be the fastest out of all competing teams.
This brought great success to team 254, 111, and 973, earning them each a
championship title. The 3rd for 111 and the 1st for 254 and 973. After the
2011 championship 254 had officialy became the first team to achieve every
award possible and now has 31 blue banners. This is the first year that 2
teams from california have won the championship.

With only 12 students in 2011, 973 is the 3rd smallest team to ever win
champs, and the first team since 2004 to win champs with less than 20
students. Making 973's motto 'OUTWORK US' worthy.
