##  History

Shaker Robotics was founded in the spring of 2008 as the Shaker Techology Club
by a former FRC Team 1726 mentor, a young technology teacher, and two
students. By the fall of 2008 the club had grown to 10 student members who
decided to compete in the 2009 FIRST robotics competition. Today, the club is
known as the Shaker Robotics Team and has over 20 student members including 5
femailes and 4 full time mentors. They closely collaborate with two Arizona
teams including, their “parent teeam” FRC1726, and International Chairmans
winner FRC842, as well as individuals from 5 teams located in Texas, New
Jersey, New York, and Canada. This collaboration led to their decision to hold
a completely open build season by blogging each step in the design and build
process. The team's blog can be found at team2791.wordpress.com. Shaker
Robotics is constantly spreading the FIRST message by encouraging young people
to embrace and solve the problems of the world. To show for this, all of their
graduates are attending 4 year engineering programs at UC Berkeley, Clarkson,
and University at Albany. The current senior class will be attending the
engineering and computer science programs at RIT, University of Arizona,
Siena, and Clarkson.


## EWCP

Team 2791 is a member of the East West Collaboration Project started by Akash
Rastogi (3553) and Ranjit Chanal (1323). EWCP also does periodic podcasts
throughout the year on various topics the panel deems important to the FIRST
community.
