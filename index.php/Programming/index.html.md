    _[FIRST Lego League](/index.php/FIRST_Lego_League "FIRST Lego League" ) also has a page about [Programming](/index.php/Programming_%28FLL%29 "Programming \(FLL\)" )._

  
**Programming** is an integral part of building a [robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ). [Fabrication](/index.php/Fabrication "Fabrication" ) is necessary to have something to work with; but, without the brains, the robot is impotent. This is where programming comes in. A program is simply a set of instructions to the computer (the [Robot Controller](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ) in this case). The computer then responds, based on these instructions. The response might be effecting an actuator, sending power to a motor, or anything else the programmer desires.

## Programming in FRC

For the [FIRST Robotics Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition
"FIRST Robotics Competition" ), programming is done using a programming
language and is [downloaded](/index.php/Downloading_a_program "Downloading a
program" ) to the [RC](/index.php/Robot_Controller "Robot Controller" ).

In the past, the robot controller has been programmed using a language such as
[PIC C](/index.php/PIC_C "PIC C" ) although it could also be programmed in
[assembly](/index.php/Assembly "Assembly" ) or the C code can have assembly in
it. This generally isn't done unless speed is really important, and the need
outweighs the costs in code maintenance.

Since 2009, the robot controller, [cRio FRC](/index.php/CRio_FRC "CRio FRC" ),
can be programmed using C/C++ (with WindRiver), LabVIEW, or Java (with
NetBeans).

There is a newer version called [cRio FRC II](/index.php/CRio_FRC_II "CRio FRC
II" ).

## Autonomous Mode

Note that beginning with [Stack Attack](/index.php/Stack_Attack "Stack Attack"
) in 2003, [FRC games](/index.php/FRC_games "FRC games" ) have included an
[autonomous mode](/index.php/Autonomous_mode "Autonomous mode" ) \-- a period
of time, so far 15 seconds at the beginning of the match, under which the
robot must act without user input. This is a major challenge to programming
the robot, and can be as complicated as a large network of
[sensors](/index.php/Sensor "Sensor" ) with many lines of code ... or as
simple as a trial-and-error [dead reckoning](/index.php/Dead_reckoning "Dead
reckoning" ) solution.
