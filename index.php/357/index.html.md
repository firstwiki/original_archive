### Team 357 Web-Site

[Team357.org](http://www.team357.org "http://www.team357.org" ) is an Advanced
Student-Written Content Management System that allows each member (alumni,
mentors, and students) to have their own account. Each account may be granted
access to specific things such as Article Publishing, Photo Gallery
Management, and Calendar Management by a mentor or Student Administrator (Web
Team Manager).


#### Method of Storage

The website's system stores it's information on a
[PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" )
frontend and a [mySQL database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" ) backend. The website makes queries to
this database everytime it gives data feedback to the user. The database is
used to store all the information including, but not limited to account
profiles, media file location, sub-team membership records, articles, and so
forth.


#### User Accounts

[Every team member](http://team357.org/?page=members
"http://team357.org/?page=members" ) is given a password-protected account for
use on the website. The website uses the 'feature-access-specific' concept.
This is so that an administrator may grant any given user access to manipulate
one thing, but not to another. All accounts have profile and contact
information associate with them. Because this information is considered
private, you must be logged in as a member to view this information.


##### Membership Types

  * Administrative 
    * Mentor - User has administrative access to each feature, but is not a student. 
    * Student Administrator (aka Root)- User has administrative access to each feature. This user type is reserved to student web-team leaders. 
  * Non-Administrative 
    * Alumni - This user has a primarily non-active role on the team. In the event an alumni may wish to remain on the database for recognition purposes, they are given this status. Alumni can also be granted individual access to web-site features if needed. 
    * Student - This user by default has very minimal access. A student's default access privileges are: Team Emailer and Subteam Manager. A student may be granted seperate privilages by an administrative user. 


#### Control Functions

The following are features that are used in the Account Control Panel.

**Note**: a * denotes that the user must be given access to a feature before it comes available to be used. 

**Note**: a ** denotes that the feature is for mentors and student administrators only. 

  * **Team Emailer**\- Allows a user to send out an email to every user on the database. A user may optionally send to all mentors only. 
  * **Subteam Manager**\- Student users may join a sub-team. This is primarily used so that users may receive sub-team specific information, rather then submitting ilrelevant information to the entire team 
    * **Sub-team Leader Manager**\- If a person is a leader of a specific subteam, they may approve/decline join requests to their sub-team, appoint other leaders for their sub-team, and manually add users to their sub-team. 
      * **Mentor Sub-team Manager** **- This is the same as above, but it allows mentors to have 'sub-team leader' access to all sub-teams. This is available to student administrators too.  

  * **Downloads**\- Users may download files that are provided by student administrators and mentors. Files may include permission slips, medical releases, etc.  

  * **Article Publishing** *- Users may publish articles that cover recent team events. Each article, when approved, is visible on the website for the public to see. Article Add, and Article Editing are two different "Permission Sets" so a user may be given privileges to add an article, but not to edit any.  

  * **Article Queue** **- After a user publishes an article, it must be approved by a mentor or student administrator. The article may also be edited from here. 
  * **User Manager** **- Mentors and Student Administrators may edit another user's account. All profile information and account information (username and password, for example) may be changed using this feature 
  * **Sponsor Manager** **- Sponsors are recognized through the addition of their information via this function 
  * **Log Viewer** **- Upon any event triggered by a user (User Edit, Article Edit, etc) a log is saved in the database. Administrators will review these often to monitor for abuse. 
  * **Media Manager** *- This feature corresponds with the media section on the website. Image and video files may be uploaded through an HTML form. Also adding categories is possible through this. Due to technical restrictions, it may impossible to upload larger (generally video) files through the HTML form. To bypass this restriction, it is possible to upload by sending the file through a FTP stream then using the website to scan the folder the file was uploaded to for any new files. 


#### Original Web-Team

The original web-team was formed in October of 2005. Its primary goal was to
establish and maintain a website for Team 357. The goal of the web-team was to
make the original entirely [HTML-based web-
site](http://www.first.udsd.k12.pa.us "http://www.first.udsd.k12.pa.us" )
obsolete, and replace it with a completely database-driven dynamic website.
The primary reason for this was to increase the speed of any updates and to
add interactivity for the team members. The original website was located on
[Upper Darby School District's](http://www.udsd.k12.pa.us
"http://www.udsd.k12.pa.us" ) servers, which for security reasons prevented
students being able to directly update the pages.


##### Original Web-Team Members

[Jonathan Knippschild](http://team357.org/?page=profile&user=1
"http://team357.org/?page=profile&user=1" ) is the primary coder of the web-
site. He is a member of the Class 2007 of [Upper Darby High
School](http://www.udsd.k12.pa.us/schools/highschool/udhs.php?school=ud
"http://www.udsd.k12.pa.us/schools/highschool/udhs.php?school=ud" ). Jonathan
Knippschild can write in PHP, HTML, and [mIRC
API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_script
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC_script" ). Jonathan Knippschild was asked
by Mr. Troy, the Chief Mentor of Team 357, to join the team.

[Andrew Adaman](http://team357.org/?page=profile&user=11
"http://team357.org/?page=profile&user=11" ) is a very loyal Royal Assault
team member. Andrew Adaman is a member of the Class of 2007 of Upper Darby
High School. Andrew Adaman participates in many different parts of the team,
including Scouting &amp; Scoring and the Database team. Andrew Adaman is
responsible for checking for syntax and general coding syntax for the website.
