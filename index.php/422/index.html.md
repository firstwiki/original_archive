  * [2007 - Phoenix Phenomenon](/index.php/Phoenix_Phenomenon_%28422%29_2007 "Phoenix Phenomenon \(422\) 2007" )

The team was split 50%/50% between the names Phoenix Phenomenon and Phoenix
Quatro (The Power of Titanium). The Team Leader, Tom Fisher, threw the
deciding vote for Phenomenon. The bot's chassis is shaped like an octagon, and
sports an omni-directional drive train with one motor per wheel. The Tuber
Scooper is the device on the end of the arm that has three hinged "fingers"
which slide under the ringers and picks them up. Phoenix Phenomenon is a
decent scoring bot, but is almost completely shut down once an opponent
decides to defend against it. The team placed 58th out of 66 teams at the
NASA/VCU Regional, and 40th out of 44 at the Philadelphia Regional.

  * [2006 - Phoenix v3.14](/index.php/Phoenix_v3.14_%28422%29_2006 "Phoenix v3.14 \(422\) 2006" )

[![Image:422-Pi.jpg](/media/e/e5/422-Pi.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-Pi.jpg
"Image:422-Pi.jpg" )

Also called Pi-bot. It was designed to only score in the low goals, and has a
two-wheel drive with two skids on the front end. It uses a rotating drum to
collect the balls into its hopper area, and then switches the drum's direction
to release the balls into the goal. It won the Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's
Technology" Award in 2006 for its DILIH system (pronounced "Dealy"), or Drop
It Like It's Hot. The system uses two pneumatic pistons with square sections
of grippy material to lift the front end of the bot off the ground. The system
was used to stop other robots from pushing it and needed to be deployed in
order for the robot to score. Pi-bot had issues with balance and fell onto
it's backside upwards of 7-8 times during the NASA/VCU Regional in Richmond.
The team made adjustments and came in as the second seed in Palmetto with only
one loss.

  * [2005 - TryForce](/index.php/TryForce_%28422%29_2005 "TryForce \(422\) 2005" )

[![Image:422-TryForce.jpg](/media/7/77/422-TryForce.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422
-TryForce.jpg "Image:422-TryForce.jpg" )

The name is a reference to the Legend of Zelda's Triforce. The robot
originally had four-wheel drive, but had issues turning so it was changed to
rear-wheel only. It has an outrigger system that deploys a type of claw made
out of copper tubing, which helps prevent the robot from falling forward when
burdened with a Tetra. The robot had a simple hook with a crosspiece attached
to the arm for capping tetras. TryForce is no longer completely together or
functional.

* * *

  * [2004 - Phoenix Rising](/index.php/Phoenix_Rising_%28422%29_2004 "Phoenix Rising \(422\) 2004" )

[![Image:422-prising.jpg](/media/2/25/422-prising.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-p
rising.jpg "Image:422-prising.jpg" )

This bot moves somewhere around 11 feet per second. It has a large, double-
hooked, pneumatic arm that it uses to pull itself up onto the bar at the end
of the matches. This arm is so large however, that the robot is fairly top-
heavy and is prone to tipping when jerkily controlled. It still functions
today.

* * *

  * [2003 - Phoenix](/index.php/Phoenix_%28422%29_2003 "Phoenix \(422\) 2003" )

[![Image:422-phoenix.jpg](/media/2/2a/422-phoenix.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-p
hoenix.jpg "Image:422-phoenix.jpg" )

Never saw a Regional Competition, as it was a replacement bot built after
build season. It still functions today.

* * *

  * [2003 - Functional Decoration](/index.php/Functional_Decoration_%28422%29 "Functional Decoration \(422\)" )

[![Image:422-Funky.jpg](/media/c/c0/422-Funky.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-Funky
.jpg "Image:422-Funky.jpg" )

Also called Funky, named after the rule that most materials are allowable as
nonfunctional decorations. It was shipped in a crate and showed up in pieces,
so the team had to make another robot, Phoenix.

* * *

  * [2002 - IT](/index.php/IT_%28422%29_2002 "IT \(422\) 2002" )

[![Image:422-IT.jpg](/media/b/b1/422-IT.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-IT.jpg
"Image:422-IT.jpg" )

(pronounced eye-tee)

  * [2001 - Peacemaker](/index.php/Peacemaker_%28422%29_2001 "Peacemaker \(422\) 2001" )

[![Image:422-Peacie.jpg](/media/f/f3/422-Peacie.jpg)](/index.php/Image:422-Pea
cie.jpg "Image:422-Peacie.jpg" )

Also called Peacie. It won the Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" Award
for its modular design with completely removable electronics and pneumatics.
This allows for work on all 3 systems simultaneously without the hassle of
other people in the way.

* * *

  * [2000 - Gruntmaster 9000](/index.php/Gruntmaster_9000_%28422%29_2000 "Gruntmaster 9000 \(422\) 2000" )

Also called Grunty.

[[edit](/index.php?title=422&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section:
Accomplishments" )]

## Accomplishments

  * 2006 Palmetto Regional: Team 422 was seeded second out of 48 teams at the end of qualifying matches, with only one loss. 
  * Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" 2006 - (see below). this award was given in recognition of the DILIH (pronounced "Dealy"), or Drop it Like its Hot, pneumatic brake system. When activated, this system deployed two ultra-frictiony neopreme surfaces onto the ground, raising the front end of the robot off the ground, making it unpushable. 
  * NASA/VCU Regional Winner 2002 - This award celebrates the team or alliance that wins the competition. 
  * Capitol Clash 2005: 2nd Place - This award celebrates the team or alliance that makes it to the final match of the competition. 
  * Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" 2001 - This award celebrates an elegant and advantageous machine feature. This award recognizes any aspect of engineering elegance including, but not limited to: design, wiring methods, material selection, programming techniques, and unique machine attributes. The criteria for this award are based on the teamâ€™s ability to concisely describe verbally, as well as demonstrate, this chosen machine feature. In this case, it was awarded for the modularity of that year's robot, which had its electronics and pneumatics attached on Lexan boards to an aluminum cage Velcroed to the chassis. This allowed easy access to the drive train for repairs and allowed independent work on the three main systems. 
  * Judges' Award 2004 - During the course of the competition, the judging panel may encounter a team whose unique efforts, performance, or dynamics merit recognition. 
  * FIRST LEGO League Regional Outstanding Volunteer Award 2003, awarded at the Richmond event, which the team hosts yearly. 
  * Special Recognition - Capital Clash 2005 - Special Recognition for volunteer effort aiding this off-season competition.
