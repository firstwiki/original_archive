# FLL Official Tournaments

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

This is a listing of **FLL Official Tournaments** for states in the USA and
provinces in Canada. These may also more informally be known as State
Tournaments or Provincial Tournaments.

Most states in the USA will have only one top level tournament that complete
the FLL season in that state. This will be called the Official Tournament on
the FLL website as this tournament will qualify the winner to attend the [FLL
World Festival](/index.php/FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival" ). Some
larger states (either in teams or geography) may have multiple Official
Tournaments listed on this page. In this case these states may qualify more
than one team to attend the FLL World Festival. Examples include New York and
California.
