This is a listing of **FLL Official Tournaments** for states in the USA and provinces in Canada. These may also more informally be known as State Tournaments or Provincial Tournaments.

Most states in the USA will have only one top level tournament that complete the FLL season in that state. This will be called the Official Tournament on the FLL website as this tournament will qualify the winner to attend the [FLL World Festival](FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival"). Some larger states (either in teams or geography) may have multiple Official Tournaments listed on this page. In this case these states may qualify more than one team to attend the FLL World Festival. Examples include New York and California.

FLL Tournament Structure:

- [FLL World Festival](FLL_World_Festival "FLL World Festival")
- [Championship Tournaments](FLL_Championship_Tournament "FLL Championship Tournament") (includes State Tournaments, [Open European Championship](FLL_Open_European_Championship "FLL Open European Championship"))
- [Qualifying Tournaments](FLL_Qualifying_Tournament "FLL Qualifying Tournament") / [Regional Tournaments](FLL_Regional_Tournament "FLL Regional Tournament")
- [Local Tournaments](FLL_Local_Tournament "FLL Local Tournament")
