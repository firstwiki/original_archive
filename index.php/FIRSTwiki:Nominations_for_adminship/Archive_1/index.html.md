## Nominations for sysopship

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for_adminship/Archive_1&action=
edit&section=2 "Edit section: Brandon Martus; \(4/0/0\)" )]

### [Brandon Martus](/index.php/User:Brandon_Martus "User:Brandon Martus" );
(4/0/0)

**Granted** \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 00:30, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Brandon is webmaster for [ChiefDelphi](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" )
which is the [FIRSTwiki](/index.php/FIRSTwiki "FIRSTwiki" )'s host. In
addition, Brandon may be needed to do certain server-side administrative
duties, like installation of various modules.

I graciously accept. I don't know how much I can help out on a regular basis,
but I am here for any technical questions you may have. I also will be editing
and browsing as a normal user, too. :) - [Brandon
Martus](/index.php/User:Brandon_Martus "User:Brandon Martus" )

  
**Support**

  1. Not to mention he probably has more expierience than the rest of us combined. Besides, he's too busy w/CD to do much contributing. :D --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 23:04, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  2. How can he not be an admin when I spend so much time asking him for help with the site? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 20:00, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  3. If Brandom wants to, sure, why not? :) I wonder if he will even have time to check up around here often. Well, my vote is for him. --[Texan](/index.php/User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 09:36, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  4. Brandon is t3h h4x0r. Supportage. --[Billfred](/index.php/User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 14:23, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

**Oppose**

**Neutral**

  1. I know that Brandon has not contributed many edits, but my explanation above seems to validate an exception. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 23:01, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for_adminship/Archive_1&action=
edit&section=3 "Edit section: Astronouth7303; \(5/0/0\)" )]

### [Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" );
(5/0/0)

**Granted** \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 00:30, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Astronouth is one of the first significant contributors to FIRSTwiki and has
been very helpful in many circumstances including trying to recruit users,
temporary logo, etc.

Astronouth7303 graciously accepts.

**Support**

  1. Has contributed many articles, edits. --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 22:53, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  2. Very helpful over at CD, so I say yay. --[Texan](/index.php/User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 14:24, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  3. I don't know ... if we just let everyone be a sysop, I won't feel so special anymore. But I guess, so long as it doesn't encroach upon my superhero sysop'ing power, I have no real objection. Well, a minor one maybe. He graciously accepted (oh, and as for bad spelling, see above too :D ). Whatever happened to professionally accepting, eh? Oh, and I'm actually supporting the nomination (and the one below this, and what the heck, Brandon too) ... I just feel like making the other sysops work extra hard to know what I mean. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 17:10, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  4. I have to say. I made a mistake using redirect and realized it about a minute later. When I came back to fix my error Astronouth had already been their and corrected it. So he has my vote.--[Ngreen](/index.php/User:Ngreen "User:Ngreen" ) 12:33, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  5. Anyone who shares my birthday has the required cool factor...well, unless Osama Bin Laden's birthday is May 20 or something like that. He doesn't have the cool factor, but Astro does. But back to the topic, he'll do well. --[Billfred](/index.php/User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 14:25, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

**Oppose**

**Neutral**

  1. Bad spelling. See below.  :p --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 23:00, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

[[edit](/index.php?title=FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for_adminship/Archive_1&action=
edit&section=4 "Edit section: Phrontist; \(3/0/0\)" )]

### [Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ); (3/0/0)

**Granted** \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 00:30, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Phrontist is one of the first significant contributors to FIRSTwiki. He
actually prompted the idea in the first place...

  * Oh my god!!! *joyful shriek* w00t! I mean, uh, *ahem* I, grudgingly accept --[Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) 23:08, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT) ;-) 

**Support**

  1. Many contributions --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 22:54, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  2. Has stayed up at least 1 late night to help get this thing (really) going. Definently one of the people I would go to with a question. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 22:57, 8 Jun 2004 (EDT) 
  3. Oh, what the heck. I'll vote for him too. Nice guy over at CD, other than the fact he doesn't appreciate classes enough... ;) --[Texan](/index.php/User:Texan "User:Texan" ) 09:36, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT)

  1. Thanks, I plan to invest a lot of time this summer. This school year has been hectic for me. If you think I make a lot of contributions now, wait till I don't have to choose between passing english and contributing to wiki :-) --[Phrontist](/index.php/User:Phrontist "User:Phrontist" ) 15:17, 9 Jun 2004 (EDT)
