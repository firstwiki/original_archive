[Nominations for adminship/Archive

"FIRSTwiki:Nominations for adminship/Archive 1" )

_See existing [administrators](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Administrators
"FIRSTwiki:Administrators" )._

Please use [wikipedia:Requests for
adminship](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship
"wikipedia:wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship" ) as a guide for nominating and
formatting.

Most importantly, an admin should have thorough knowledge of FIRSTwiki and
should visit meta pages often. It is preferred if the admin has had a large
amount of edits (In the top 20% of editors), and contributes on a relatively
regular basis.

As the Wikipedia guide linked to above indicates, only users who are
registered and logged in can vote and/or be nominated.

If you don't know whether to nominate a user as a sysop or as a bureaucrat, go
with "sysop" by default. If a user has been doing well as a sysop, then
nominate him/her as a "bureaucrat."

I have six years of experience on Wikipedia, and nearly 5,000 edits on
Wikipedia. I am very skilled with MediaWiki syntax, and I have run MediaWiki
on websites before, so I know how the software works. With a few other
editors, I helped revamp many of the Wikipedia articles about FIRST. Please
consider me for a sysop position. I am a proud FRC alumnus.

###  [Keatonic](/index.php/User:Keatonic "User:Keatonic" )

I'm Keaton Mantz, I'm a senior on Team 27 (RUSH from Clarkston, Michigan) and
on the media and management subteam, as well as the presentations and
community impact subteam. I've been involved in FIRST via other teams since
before I was in high school. I'm a web developer by nature (PHP, JavaScript
(jQuery!) HTML and CSS), but I've done work with graphics and programming
(LabVIEW and Visual Basic). I've hosted and helped run several Media Wiki
sites, as well as several large forums, so I know how to run websites and
wikis. I'd love to help revive FIRSTWiki, as I see it's potential for many
teams, old and new. As a Freshman, I think I went on it almost every other day
during build season to find out more about FIRST. I'm a strong leader who will
never leave a project once committed, and I'm currently not involved in any
online projects. Again, I'd love to help bring FIRSTWiki back up to par doing
whatever we need to do. -[Keatonic](/index.php/User:Keatonic "User:Keatonic" )

## 2011 FIRSTwiki Revival Bureaucrat Nominations

###  [Hallry](/index.php/User:Hallry "User:Hallry" )

Hello all, I am Ryan and the one who originally posted the thread on Chief
Delphi about reviving the wiki. I feel like it would be a good idea for me to
become a bureaucrat, since I am very familiar with wiki 'language,' and am
quite skilled at it, and am also 'leading' the project to fix up the site. I
am also Co-CEO of the Pascack Pi-oneers, Team 1676, for the 2011-2012 school
year, and as such, have very good leadership qualities. I am very dedicated to
getting this wiki cleaned up, and would make sure that needed work gets done
in a timely manner. I would love to become a bureaucrat, and it seems like the
only current one, Max, is not that involved anymore. For examples of my
contributions, I have been a large part of fixing up my team's wiki page
([1676](/index.php/1676 "1676" )), and have created pages for each of our
seasons so far, as well as this template for them (found
[here](/index.php/Template:Toc/1676 "Template:Toc/1676" )). I became an admin
on May 25th, 2011, and within an hour had deleted all of the pages marked for
deletion, updated the "Featured Article" and "What's happening now" sections
on the Main Page, and also updated the 'sitenotice' template to show that the
wiki is currently being revived. I hope everyone understands why I see myself
as qualified for this job.
