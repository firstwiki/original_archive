[Nominations for adminship/Archive 1](FIRSTwiki:Nominations_for_adminship/Archive_1 "FIRSTwiki:Nominations for adminship/Archive 1")

_See existing [administrators](FIRSTwiki:Administrators "FIRSTwiki:Administrators")._

Please use [wikipedia:Requests for adminship](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship "wikipedia:wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship") as a guide for nominating and formatting.

Most importantly, an admin should have thorough knowledge of FIRSTwiki and should visit meta pages often. It is preferred if the admin has had a large amount of edits (In the top 20% of editors), and contributes on a relatively regular basis.

As the Wikipedia guide linked to above indicates, only users who are registered and logged in can vote and/or be nominated.

If you don't know whether to nominate a user as a sysop or as a bureaucrat, go with "sysop" by default. If a user has been doing well as a sysop, then nominate him/her as a "bureaucrat."

### [Member](User:Member "User:Member")

I have six years of experience on Wikipedia, and nearly 5,000 edits on Wikipedia. I am very skilled with MediaWiki syntax, and I have run MediaWiki on websites before, so I know how the software works. With a few other editors, I helped revamp many of the Wikipedia articles about FIRST. Please consider me for a sysop position. I am a proud FRC alumnus.

### [Keatonic](User:Keatonic "User:Keatonic")

I'm Keaton Mantz, I'm a senior on Team 27 (RUSH from Clarkston, Michigan) and on the media and management subteam, as well as the presentations and community impact subteam. I've been involved in FIRST via other teams since before I was in high school. I'm a web developer by nature (PHP, JavaScript (jQuery!) HTML and CSS), but I've done work with graphics and programming (LabVIEW and Visual Basic). I've hosted and helped run several Media Wiki sites, as well as several large forums, so I know how to run websites and wikis. I'd love to help revive FIRSTWiki, as I see it's potential for many teams, old and new. As a Freshman, I think I went on it almost every other day during build season to find out more about FIRST. I'm a strong leader who will never leave a project once committed, and I'm currently not involved in any online projects. Again, I'd love to help bring FIRSTWiki back up to par doing whatever we need to do. -[Keatonic](User:Keatonic "User:Keatonic") 13:40 June 25th 2011 (EDT)

## 2011 FIRSTwiki Revival Bureaucrat Nominations

### [Hallry](User:Hallry "User:Hallry")

Hello all, I am Ryan and the one who originally posted the thread on Chief Delphi about reviving the wiki. I feel like it would be a good idea for me to become a bureaucrat, since I am very familiar with wiki 'language,' and am quite skilled at it, and am also 'leading' the project to fix up the site. I am also Co-CEO of the Pascack Pi-oneers, Team 1676, for the 2011-2012 school year, and as such, have very good leadership qualities. I am very dedicated to getting this wiki cleaned up, and would make sure that needed work gets done in a timely manner. I would love to become a bureaucrat, and it seems like the only current one, Max, is not that involved anymore. For examples of my contributions, I have been a large part of fixing up my team's wiki page ([1676](1676 "1676")), and have created pages for each of our seasons so far, as well as this template for them (found [here](Template:Toc/1676 "Template:Toc/1676")). I became an admin on May 25th, 2011, and within an hour had deleted all of the pages marked for deletion, updated the "Featured Article" and "What's happening now" sections on the Main Page, and also updated the 'sitenotice' template to show that the wiki is currently being revived. I hope everyone understands why I see myself as qualified for this job.
