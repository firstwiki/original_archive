## Welcome Robomaniacs!!

Nice page! Did you follow my tutorial? If so, I'm curious to get your feedback on how easy it was to follow. I'm hoping to put an email out to all the World Festival teams to see if we can get some of them to do this (and so we'll have some sample team pages already out there) - then put an announcement on the Forum when it opens in September. I think this will be a great resource to make it easy for FLL teams to find out about other teams, tournaments and tournament results, how-to's, etc.

One suggestion - go ahead and create yourself a user page. For example mine is **[User:PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll")**. If you go to my user page and click Discussion then this is a way to leave a "message" for someone - almost like a mailbox. If you create a user page I can do the same. Then all you have to do is check that page or look for your name in the **[Recent Changes](Special:Recentchanges "Special:Recentchanges")** screen.

To create a user page for yourself just follow this link (after you've logged in) - **[User:Robomaniacs](/index.php?title=User:Robomaniacs&action=edit "User:Robomaniacs")** - and put a bit of text in. Cheers, [PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll") 13:35, 8 Aug 2005 (EDT)
