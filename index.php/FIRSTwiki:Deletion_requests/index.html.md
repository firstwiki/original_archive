## Requests for speedy deletion

[User:Goobergunch/Cleanup](/index.php?title=User:Goobergunch/Cleanup&action=ed
it "User:Goobergunch/Cleanup" )

    Merged into [User:Goobergunch/Plan](/index.php/User:Goobergunch/Plan "User:Goobergunch/Plan" ), requesting deletion of unneccessary personal subpage. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 17:37, 7 Aug 2004 (EDT) 

    **no problem, done.** \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 01:34, 8 Aug 2004 (EDT) 

[Islamonazism](/index.php?title=Islamonazism&action=edit "Islamonazism" )

    Looks like some random person posted this trying to make a point. Not sure what, since I skimmed it. But whatever it is, it's definitely not FIRST-related. --[Billfred](/index.php/User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 20:14, 20 Sep 2004 (EDT) 

    And on a side note after I edited--why is the deletion policy redlinkified? We just don't have one? (I can whip one up, if you'd like.) --[Billfred](/index.php/User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 20:16, 20 Sep 2004 (EDT) 
    [Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#Islamonazism](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion#Islamonazism "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" ) \- VfD entry on Wikipedia on this article. --[Goobergunch](/index.php/User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) [[1168](/index.php/1168 "1168" )] 8:18, 21 Sep 2004 (EDT) 
    **Done. A comment also left on the IP's talk page.** \--[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 18:35, 21 Sep 2004 (EDT) 

[Rules of Acquisition: Guideline for the Modern Jew](/index.php?title=Rules_of
_Acquisition:_Guideline_for_the_Modern_Jew&action=edit "Rules of Acquisition:
Guideline for the Modern Jew" )

    Do I even really have to say why this should be deleted? Really, do I? --[Billfred](/index.php/User:Billfred "User:Billfred" ) 23:40, 12 Oct 2004 (EDT) 

  * **Keep it!** \- Everyone knows that the modern world is a Jewish disease. This disease is abstraction, they're obsessed with abstraction. They undermine traditional life and they derasinate society. A real people thrives its genius from the land, from the sun, from the sea, from the soil. This is how they know themselves. But Jews don't even have soil. Except fro the Israelis, who are not real Jews. Israel is fundamentaly secular society. They don't need Judaism because they have soil. Because a real jew is a wanderer. He's a nomad. He has no roots and no attachments so he universalizes everything. He can't hammer a nail or plow a field. All he can do is buy and sell and invest capital and manipulate markets. It's all mental. He takes the life of a people that are rooted in soil and then he turns it into this cosmopolitan culture. Based on books and numbers and ideas. This is his strength. You can take the greatest Jewish minds ever. Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us. Communism, infantile sexuality, and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries its taken these people to emerge from the ghettoes of Europe, they've ripped us out of a world of order and reason. They've thrown us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges, and relativity. Into a world now where the very existence of matter and meaning is in question. Why! Because its the deepest impulse of a Jewish soul to pull at the very fabric of life until there's nothing left but a thread. They want nothing but nothingness. _Nothingness without end!_ \-- [John-Kerry](/index.php?title=User:John-Kerry&action=edit "User:John-Kerry" ) 00:37, 13 Oct 2004 (EDT) 

    **Deleted**, no explanation needed... --[[User:Max|[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) [[1257](/index.php/1257 "1257" )]]] 11:32, 13 Oct 2004 (EDT)

## Decisions in progress

[Andy Baker](/index.php/Andy_Baker "Andy Baker" )

    Misuse of page (should be on user page, not general namespace. But instead of deletion, I would recommend an actual article going here. He is a WFA winner and there's certainly a lot to say about this (potential) _Survivor_. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 13:11, 4 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I agree that the page is being misused. Messages to user are not needed in the normal page. See the [Style guide](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Style_guide "FIRSTwiki:Style guide" ) policies on user pages. If a "person" is also a "user" the person page should JUST redirect to the "User:" page. ALL content should go on the user page. All "commentary" should go on the talk page of that user. Adding redirect now... --[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) 18:31, 4 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

  
[Evette (1083)](/index.php/Evette_%281083%29 "Evette \(1083\)" )

    Page contains no factual information and no information remotely relevant to the title of the page. This page should not need to exist unless there is relevent information on the robot able to be posted. Recommend either deletion until relevent data available or replacement of current page with more productive article on robot if such exists. - [Jay](/index.php/User:JVGazeley "User:JVGazeley" ) 15:08, 12 Aug 2005 (EDT) 

    

    **Withdrawing request** due to factual information finally being added to this page. - [Jay](/index.php/User:JVGazeley "User:JVGazeley" ) 09:20, 7 Sep 2005 (EDT)
