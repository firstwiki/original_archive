2006 team photo

Team 461, Westside Boiler Invasion, is based in West Lafayette, Indiana. The
team is comprised of students from West Lafayette High School. Most of the
team's mentors are students at Purdue University, but Team 461 also receives
help from various
volunteers[[1]](http://www.boilerinvasion.org/index.php?page=volunteers
"http://www.boilerinvasion.org/index.php?page=volunteers" ).

The team's name is drawn from Purdue University's sports teams, the
Boilermakers, based on the team's involvement with Purdue.

In 2004, WBI earned the Leadership in Control award at the Great Lakes
Regional, the Website Award at the Midwest Regional, and were Curie Division
finalists at the Championship Event.

In 2006 and 2010, WBI 461 won the best website award at the Buckeye Regional,
Boilermaker Regional, and won the Championship title at Atlanta as well.

WBI is well-known throughout the first community for its chant: "Let's all go
nuts! Robots! Robots!"

## History

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1999" )]

### 1999

Early in 1999, the Outreach Team of the Purdue Student Engineering Foundation
(PSEF), led by Steve Hann, decided to start a FIRST Robotics team. Most on the
Outreach Team had never heard of FIRST, but the program meshed perfectly with
their mission: informing high school students about the endless opportunities
available in science and technology. At the start of next school year, PSEF
members (one of whom had been on a FIRST team in high school), and professors
got together and came up with a strategy to bring a FIRST team to the Greater
Lafayette area. Mr. Hann contacted West Lafayette High School teacher Steve
Florence, who jointly agreed to establish this program. PSEF established a
subgroup, headed by Shannon Schnepp, to create this team. This team came to be
located at West Lafayette High School. A callout was held to recruit advisors
--Purdue students who would help high school students achieve the dream of
building a real, working robot. These initial students would be the core of
the 2000 FIRST team, later to be strengthened by students from other local
high schools.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 2000" )]

### 2000

In January of 2000, the team, Westside Boiler Invasion 461 (WBI 461), tackled
the challenge of designing a robot. The robot was named Rowdy Pete 1,
reflecting Purdue's great influence on WBI 461. In the first year, Westside
Boiler Invasion was comprised of 18 high school students from West Lafayette
and Harrison High Schools and 12 Purdue University students. The team was
unique in the fact that it was completely student run. The team competed in
the Motorola Midwest Regional, taking home the Rookie All-Star award. But the
memories and hard work didn't stop there. At that time, the team did not have
enough funds to buy uniforms (the team tie-dyed their own shirts, earning the
nickname "Team Sherbet"), let alone attend the National Championship, which is
the culminating event of the season. The advisors knew the great benefit of
competing at nationals and did not want to let this opportunity pass by. Thus,
everything possible was done to raise money: begging companies, getting
donations from alumni, and even getting another team (Truck Town Terror #68,
now called Truck Town Thunder) to pay for the hotel. The gracious
professionalism paid to WBI 461 was immeasurable. All the effort put forth by
the team paid off when Westside Boiler Invasion qualified for nationals at
Motorola. Our team also set its precedent of being extremely spirited. Even
though no awards were won at nationals, the fact that the team got there was
enough to make it among the best experiences of everyone on the team.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 2001" )]

### 2001

In 2001, new students were brought on the team, raising the numbers to 22 high
school students from West Lafayette, Harrison, and Jefferson high schools, 18
Purdue students, 2 high school teachers, and 3 industry professionals. More of
the new advisors had been on teams in high school themselves, and the
diversity and experience brought to WBI became a huge asset to the team.
Funding improved and the team was able to attend the Motorola Midwest Regional
and the National Championship. The team also went to several post-national
competitions, the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI) and the Ford Sweet
Repeat (FSR). The team took home the Daimler Chrysler Spirit Award from the
Motorola Regional and the Teamwork Award from the IRI. The season was capped
off by winning both the entire tournament and the Girl’s Championship at the
Ford Sweet Repeat (FSR).

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 2002" )]

### 2002

In its 3rd season, the team grew to 30 High School students, 25 college
advisors, 2 High School teachers, and 5 industry Professionals. By this time,
the team had established itself in FIRST and was ready to take on another
season. In 2002, the team attended 3 regionals: Buckeye Regional in Cleveland,
Motorola Midwest Regional in Chicago, and the St. Louis Regional, in St.
Louis. WBI placed 6th place overall at the Motorola Midwest Regional and 5th
place overall at the St. Louis Regional, making it the first year that WBI
made it to the final rounds. The team also won the Imagery Award at the
Buckeye Regional for their bright yellow jerseys and the Spirit Award in St.
Louis.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 2003" )]

### 2003

In its 4th season, WBI attended two regional competitions, the Buckeye
Regional in Cleveland and the Midwest Regional in Chicago. The team also
attended the National Competition, held in Houston, Texas. The team had a
successful season, bringing home 3rd place in the Animation competition, and
finishing 8th place overall at the Buckeye Regional. In Chicago, WBI was
honored with the Regional Chairman’s Award (see the Public Relations page and
the 2003 Chairman's Award page). One of only 23 teams nationally to win this
prestigious award, WBI then had the opportunity to submit an entry into the
National Chairman’s Award Competition.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: 2004" )]

### 2004

WBI's success in its fifth season was the culmination of hard work and
determination. There were 46 students from local high schools and 17 Purdue
University advisors. We attended the Great Lakes Regional in Ypsilanti,
Michigan, where WBI placed 22nd overall and was chosen by WildStang (#111),
the first seed team, for the finals. WBI was awarded the Leadership in Control
Award in honor of our programming efforts. At the Motorola Midwest Regional in
Evanston, Illinois, we won the award for Website Design. We were also chosen
as the first pick of sixth seed CFHS Robotics (#525) in elimination rounds. At
the National Competition, the WBI alliance was 2nd overall in the Curie
division, and 5th in the nation. At the 2004 Indiana Robotics Invitational,
WBI won the Animation Award for a fantastic animation made within only a day.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: 2005" )]

### 2005

2005 was WBI's sixth season. The team grew even more this year, and the focus
was on having a great robot and expanding out into the community. WBI served
as a mentor team this year to Teams 1555 at North White High School, Team
Pulse, and 1646 at Lafayette Jefferson High School, Team Boiler Precision
Guessworks. Our partnerships involved sending students and advisors to work
with the teams at their schools as well as promoting the FIRST experience.
During 2005, WBI also assisted with the operation and setup of the Boilermaker
Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana, as well as competing in it. At the
Boilermaker Regional, WBI received the Website Design award. WBI also competed
in the Motorola Midwest Regional, where we won the Team Spirit Award for BOSS
(Boiler Online Scouting System), an online database of scouting information on
all of the teams at the regional. (Scouting data can be downloaded for the
Boilermaker Regional, the Motorola Midwest Regional, and the Championship
Event in Curie division can be found here.) WBI also attended the Championship
Event in Atlanta, Georgia.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 2006" )]

### 2006

The 2006 season was WBI's seventh. Like the previous year, we mentored a
rookie team, Team 1747 at Harrison High School, Team Harrison Boiler Robotics.
WBI attended the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as the
Boilermaker Regional in West Lafayette, Indiana. The team also competed at the
Championship Event in Atlanta, Georgia. At the Buckeye Regional, Team 461 was
honored with the Website Award as well as the Engineering Inspiration Award,
the second most prestigious award in FIRST. WBI also finished the regional as
the runner-up, along with our allies Team 1018, Pike Robo-Devils, and Team
141, the Wo-Bots. WBI mentor Steve Florence was honored with the Regional
Woodie Flowers Award. At the Boilermaker Regional, WBI won the Website Award
and the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers Entrepreneurship Award. WBI
competed from April 27-29, 2006, in the Championship Event, held in Atlanta at
the Georgia Dome. At the Championship Event, WBI won the Website Award, a feat
we are extremely proud of.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 2007" )]

### 2007

WBI Team 461 had a very successful season in 2007. We attended the St. Louis
Regional last year, and won the Engineering Inspiration award, that allowed us
to travel to Nationals in Atlanta once again. We also attended our local
regional, the Boilermaker Regional where we got 2nd place on an alliance with
our sister team from Harrison High School, 1747 HBR. At Atlanta we ended our
season in the top 20 out over 80 teams in the Gallileo division. At the
Indiana Robotics Regional in July, we went on to the elimination round with a
drive team that had never driven the robot before. WBI will surely carry this
success forwards to this year's season.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: 2008" )]

### 2008

WBI competed in the Boilermaker Regional, winning 2nd place and fighting a
close final round and winning the Xerox Creativity Award. In the Great Lakes
Regional in Ypsilanti, MI, technical problems caused many losses. Not to be
discouraged, the team began to work on improvements for the Atlanta
Championship. At Atlanta, in many energy packed matches, WBI ended in the
upper half of the Archimedes Division. Unfortunately, WBI was not selected to
participate as part of an alliance in the elmination rounds. The 2008 season
has taught the team many lessons that can help us improve in the future.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: 2009" )]

### 2009

WBI is celebrating a decade of FIRST Robotics tradition. Starting off the
season at the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, OH, team 461 won the Judge's
Award for it's support of other teams with both hardware and software and was
seeded 13th at the end of qualification rounds. At the Boilermaker Regional,
suffering from technical issues, the team was seeded 31st, but was selected by
the second seed alliance of team 45, the Technokats, and team 234, Cyberblue.
The alliance made it to the finals, being narrowly defeated in a tiebreaker
match by a margin of three points. For its organization of alumni reunion,
team 461 received a Judge's Award. At the FIRST Championship event in Atlanta,
GA, team 461 made a strong showing, going 6-1 and was seeded 10th at the end
of qualification rounds. With a good season behind it, WBI looks foward to
future success in the upcoming seasons.

[[edit](/index.php?title=461&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Team
projects" )]

## Team projects

The team is an active competitor in all of the aspects of FIRST. Of course WBI
461 builds robots, but it also actively works on the animation, website, and
community service aspects of FIRST.

### Community Service

The most prestigious award in FIRST Robotics is not the robotics championship
but instead the Chairman's Award for community service. The Chairman's Award
celebrates the team that has done the most to spread the ideals of FIRST and
the promise of science and technology. See WBI 461's submissions here:

### Website

WBI 461 has long been known for its professional website. It has won many
regional best website awards, and it was the national best website winner in
2006. It has a strong forte on content and resources. The KIPs (Knowledge is
Power) tutorials compress intro-Purdue engineering into a quick series of
websites. The content on boilerinvasion.org stretches back to the 2003 season,
and new content is being added every day. WBI 461 usually implements new
themes every year. The current black and gold theme highlights the team's
links to Purdue. See the main website by clicking here:
