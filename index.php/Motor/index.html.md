    _[FIRST Lego League](FIRST_Lego_League "FIRST Lego League" ) also has a page about [Motors](Motors_%28FLL%29 "Motors \(FLL\)" )._

  
A **motor**, in the context of the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ), is a device that translates [electrical
energy](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity "wikipedia:Electricity" )
into [mechanical energy](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engergy
"wikipedia:Mechanical_engergy" ), which is most often output as [rotary
motion](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotation "wikipedia:rotation" ) along a
shaft.

Within the [kit of parts](Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ),
[FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) provides each team with a number of such
motors to be used in the construction and operation of their
[robot](Robot "Robot" ). Each motor features unique operating
characteristics and behaviors that are governed by
[physics](Physics "Physics" ) and understanding such
characteristics is important for a team to choose the correct, most efficient
motor to accomplish a given task.


##  Characteristics

For determining the efficacy of a motor in performing a certain task, there
are certain values describing that motor that are necessary for performing
some calculations.

  * **Stall torque** is the maximum [torque](Torque "Torque" ) value a given motor can produce. When a motor is said to have stalled, that indicates that its rotary motion has stopped, having reached equilibrium with its environment. Stalling a motor is not positive because of its effect on current draw. This is measured in units such as Newton*meter (N*m), inch*lbs (in*lbs.), etc. 
  * **Stall current** is the value of electrical current drawn by a motor in a stall condition. This value often exceeds the limits on [current](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "wikipedia:Electric_current" ) use imposed by [FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) and can result in damage to the motor and other electrical components. This is measured in units of amperage (A). 
  * **Free speed** is the highest speed at which the shaft rotates, measured when the force acting upon said shaft is as close to zero as possible. Zero force acting upon a shaft is impossible, however, due to environmental factors such as gravity and friction. Free speed is measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or radians per second (rad/s). 
  * **Free current** is a measurement of the current drawn to the motor under a minimum load condition, previously defined as its 'free speed'. This is measured in units of amperage (A).
