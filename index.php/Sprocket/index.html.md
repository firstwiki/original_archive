A **sprocket** is a gear or wheel with metal teeth that meshes with a chain or
track. When connecting a sprocket to a [motor](Motor "Motor" ) or
[transmission](Transmission "Transmission" ) to the
[robot](Robot "Robot" )'s [drive train](Drive_train
"Drive train" ), you can modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive.
