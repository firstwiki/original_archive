# Servo

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

A **servomechanism**, usually called a **servo** is like a
[motor](/index.php/Motor "Motor" ), expcept that it's axle goes to a specific
place instead of just spinning. They are connected to the [robot
controller](/index.php/Robot_controller "Robot controller" ) through a
[PWM](/index.php/PWM "PWM" ) interface.


## Continuous Rotation Servo

A Continuous Rotation Servo is a servo capable of rotation past 360Â°. This
allows one to use a continuous rotation servo as a small motor. Such servos
are capable of only full forward, stopped, or full reverse motion. Most servos
of this type are controlled by a [PWM](/index.php/PWM "PWM" ) signal whose
width controls the rate of turn.


## Standard Rotation Servo

Most servos are capable of only 90, 180, or 270 degrees of rotation. Such
servos are used for accurate angular positioning of a mechanism. Most servos
of this type are controlled by a [PWM](/index.php/PWM "PWM" ) signal whose
width controls the angular position of the servo.
