The Globe motor has been included in the [kit of
parts](/index.php/Kit_of_parts "Kit of parts" ) for many years. Originally a
4wd transfer case motor, the Globe motor small size, lower RPM, and high
torque make it useful for powering robot mechanisms. The globe motor comes
with an attached planetary gearbox, which may be removed if suited.

Usage Notes" )]

## Usage Notes

  * Although small, the Globe motor packs a punch for its size. It's useful for powering smaller mechanisms. Also a moderately reliable motor. 
  * The motor does not like being cantilevered, which means the output shaft of the motor must be supported on both sides to prevent damage, i.e. the face of the motor is supported and the tip of the output shaft is supported.
