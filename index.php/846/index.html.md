## History

Lynbrook Robotics is an award-winning robotics team that is currently in its sixth season. Founded in 2001 at Lynbrook High School, LRT has won several honors such as the Woodie Flowers award, the KG&B Entrepreneurial award and the Gracious Professionalism award in addition to advancing to semi-finals several times while participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition . Last year at the Silicon Valley Regionals, we seeded 4th during preliminary matches and 1st during preliminary matches at the Lone Star Regional. In the 2005-2006 season, LRT had the honor of competing at the FIRST Nationals in Atlanta,Georgia.

While not competing, we fundraise at events such as Concours d'Elegance and Fleet Week in addition to doing community presentations at places like the San Jose Tech Museum and our sponsors' companies. During the summer of 2007, we mentored a group of students at Calder Academy as well as at Oak Grove High School in San Jose, CA. We are currently mentoring 2 FLL teams composed of students from our local middle school, Miller M.S., and a collaboration of students from several local elementary schools.
