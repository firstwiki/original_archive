# 1317 in 2007

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

2007 was a big year for 1317, not just because of the accomplishments but also
the fact that the last of the original team members were graduating this year.
This meant the knowledge these five experienced team members gained from the
past 3 years had to be passed on to the next generation of Digital Fusion
teammates.

Digital Fusion made some giant leaps forward this year in the build season,
the team website, and the community outreach. In previous years when our team
tried to make a robot that could perform every task possible for the game
(lifting itself up, catching balls, going up ramps, etc...) it was never
successful. It would fall into the "Jack of all trades, master of none"
category. In a major step forward this year, the team made a robot that had an
incredibly powerful drivetrain, a simple and effective arm, and a consistent
and cool-looking lifting device. Each of these parts functioned very well
which gave the drivers a bit of an advantage to chose what they could use to
help the alliance.

The website and creative team also made a jump ahead by getting a start early
on designs and ideas. The team successfully created a new website for 2007,
which was something the team had never been able to find time to do before.

1317 attended the Buckeye Regional in Cleveland, OH, and was awarded the Xerox
Creativity Award for the unique lifting component on the robot. The team was
also selected to be on the #2 ranked alliance for the finals, but due to some
complications and poor decisions, they did not make it past the quarterfinals.
