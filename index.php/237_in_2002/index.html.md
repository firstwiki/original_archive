## Accomplishments

This is how [237](/index.php/237 "237" ) did in 2002.

### [UTC Regional](/index.php/UTC_Regional "UTC Regional" )

_Reflections from the 2002 UTC F.I.R.S.T. Competition_ \- Each year the
competition grows more exciting and the three days literally fly by.
Watertown’s robot P.A.L. (Professionally Automated Landrover) performed
extremely well for the 8 seeding matches. Probably not the best scenario, but
we started off the matches in round one with a win at 39 points-, (High score
for the competition was 150) needless to say our ranking was a low of 55 out
of 63 robots. From their on until the last match we did nothing but climb and
ended with a ranking of 19th out of 63 robot teams. Having the first seeded
team in the tournament pick us as the third robot in the first alliance was an
honor. The top eight teams pick an alliance of two teams for the final
matches. Our alliance survived the first round and made it to the semi-finals.

The students, parents, community volunteers and mentors in training are all to
be congratulated for their outstanding effort this year. On another note, the
team we mentored from Cheshire, CT #[999](/index.php/999 "999" ) received the
Rookie All-Star award. Team [716](/index.php/716 "716" ) from Housatonic
Valley Regional High School from Housatonic Valley, CT nicknamed the “Housy-
Techs” did very well also and battled to into the finals.. Team
[38](/index.php/38 "38" ) from Woodbury CT, nicknamed the "Nonnebots" also
made it to the final rounds. Team 38 was team 237's mentor team and got 237
involved in F.I.R.S.T.

  * Seeded 19th out of 63 teams 
  * Eliminated in the semifinals

### [National Championship](/index.php/National_Championship "National
Championship" )

Team 237 returned from Florida all in one piece and after having a great
competition with 291 other teams. The team realized they built the best robot
in our 4 years of existence. Our Blind Drive System (nicnamed I.D.A..N. - See
below) was nominated for a technology leadership award with the judges
visiting our pit area many times.

  * Seeded 55th out of 71 teams (Curie (Blue) Division)

## Robot

This is [237](/index.php/237 "237" )'s robot from 2002.

The Watertown High School Sie-H2O-Bots have created the 2002 PAL
(Professionally Automated Landrover) to be a combination of simplicity and
robustness. The machine uses a total of eight motors to function. These motors
include three Bosch drill motors with planetary gear transmissions, one
Fisher-Price motor with a custom built planetary gear transmission, two power
window drive motors, one air compressor with 120 psi capacity, and one small
servo motor. The final product is a durable, fast robot with good
maneuverability.

The robot consists of two operating systems controlled via remote control
through a computer-generated program. The two systems control the locomotion
of the robot as well as a grasping system to capture and release goals. These
two systems will allow the team to score points on the field by maneuvering
the goals into different positions of the field. PAL 2002 utilizes a 4-wheel
drive system. The primary drive system consists of two wheels located on the
east and west sides of the robot. These propel it forward and backward with
tank style steering via two flight sticks in the driver’s hands. Speed is
achieved with the click of a button, which activates two small air cylinders,
shifting the drill motor drives from low to high range and vice versa.

The secondary drive system wheels are located on the north and south side of
the robot. They are engaged when the primary drive wheels are raised off the
floor and the secondary drive system is lowered. In this position, the robot
moves from side to side. The tank-style steering drives are toggled by the
student driver who, at his or her discretion, regulates the speed, power, and
direction they deem necessary. During driver training, the ability of the
robot to rotate around the goals proved to be a valuable asset. It enabled the
robot under strong power to slip out of normally pinned positions with other
ambitious robots. A pneumatic system consisting of an air pump, storage tanks,
regulators, valves, flow controls, and actuator cylinders is used to give the
driver the luxury of switching drives instantly at the squeeze of a trigger.
The grasping systems consists of two “fork plates” that are located on the
north and south side of the robot. They are ¼” aluminum plate shaped like a
fork. The controls are designed to deport the fork arms by raising them
vertical to horizontal from the profile of the robot, like short wings. When
driven into the goal structures, the arms will automatically grab and hook the
goal. The second driver controls each fork arm independently with a small
control box at the driver station. Lowering the arms and driving the robot
away releases the goal. The team’s very ambitious electrical team has
developed sophisticated controls, wiring, and programming to navigate the
machine. The navigational system compliments the robot design very well.
Important symbiotic relationships continue to develop between the electrical
and mechanical systems as well as between the drivers and driver feedback
systems.

The electrical team of students and engineers has created a system that would
enable independent control of the machine by a visually impaired driver. Code
named I.D.A.N. (Intelligent Detection, Analysis and Navigation), the system
allows the robot to provide audio feedback to a laptop computer.

The cornerstone of this system is a tiny magnetic sensor that will read the
earth’s magnetic field. The signal it sends out will identify the direction
the robot is facing. This information also establishes the robot’s location
within the five zones of the playing field. An optical switch receives a
signal every time the robot moves over a line of white tape bordering each
zone.

The robot has been installed with optical switches on servomotors, which allow
it to “scan” for the goals and correct its path automatically. The optical
switches respond to the retro-reflective properties of the tape on each goal.
A pressure sensor inside the robot arms will determine that the goal is
secure. The Sie-H2O-Bot team looks forward to gaining extremely valuable
experience with this very sophisticated system as the season progresses.
