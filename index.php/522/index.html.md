## History

We are the original and famous Robo Wizards and our team number is 522. We
reign from Ralph R. McKee Vocational and Technical High School in Staten
Island, New York. As you can see, we have achieved many awards during the few
years that we have been participating in the FIRST Robotics Competitions. We
are a small team and we have a tendency of causing great damage, strategically
speaking. We also help during competitions by assisting fellow teams in such
ways: lending tools from our toolbox, helping with repairs and builds,
strategizing, and much more. You can't miss us with our vibrant, purple
shirts, wizard regalia, loud chanting, our mascots, the wizards, and most
importantly, our Teamwork and Gracious Professionalism!
