move to [FIRST LEGO League team](/index.php?title=FIRST_LEGO_League_team&action=edit "FIRST LEGO League

I don't know. A lot of pages link to [team](Team "Team" ) (a disambig page) when a link to a FIRST Robotics team is what is meant. Maybe [team (FLL)](Team_%28FLL%29 "Team \(FLL\)" ) and [team (FRC)](/index.php?title=Team_%28FRC%29&action=edit "Team \(FRC\)" ) would be short enough to get people linking to the correct pages. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 15:24, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I like the abbreviated names, too. I was thinking maybe all FLL articles should be deprecated in terms of naming conventions so [team](Team "Team" ) points to the FRC page with a note about the FLL page somewhere on it. And [team (FLL)](Team_%28FLL%29 "Team \(FLL\)" ) points to the FLL page. FIRSTwiki is primarily FRC related now, and I imagine it will always be much more FRC specific. I know, NPOV and such, but see my comment [Talk:Designing a team webpage](Talk:Designing_a_team_webpage "Talk:Designing a team webpage" ) \--[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 15:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



I would (and do) agree with that. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 15:43, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Because this is a slightly big issue, can someone else chime on in this before we make the changes? --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT) 



Ambiguous acronyms like FLL and FRC drive me nuts. I change them whenever I see them. It's lazy writing. -- [Maddie](User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )



I don't see how they would be ambiguous, especially given context. But we aren't talking about writing them out like such in the article, certainly we would use the whole name. This is a shortcut for naming the article. E.g., title is team (FLL), first sentence is A **FIRST LEGO League**, or **FLL**, **team** ... --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 13:23, 1 Jul 2004 (EDT)

**Please continue discussion about naming in [FIRSTwiki:Village pump](FIRSTwiki:Village_pump "FIRSTwiki:Village pump")** --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") 15:20, 1 Jul 2004 (EDT)
