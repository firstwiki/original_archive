NEMO can have it's own article. Don't explain it in scouting unless it's about
10x longer. --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303

One Q is how is scouting "non-technical" if it envolves solely upon computers?
as in my teams case. Just wondering about the duality of scouting. Some use
just paper others use computers. --[Stefan](/index.php/User:Stefan

    I believe the distinction of "technical" vs. "non-technical" is somewhat undefined now. For instance, scouting can be a very technical endeavor ... and so can team management. The intent, I think, is to separate pursuits directly related to the robot and pursuits related to the team as a whole, -- though currently it is somewhat arbitrary at points. Please see [FIRSTwiki:Village pump](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Village_pump "FIRSTwiki:Village pump" ) (Browse by topic section) for a discussion on a better organization scheme, and add your input. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 16:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)
