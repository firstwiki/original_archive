NEMO can have it's own article. Don't explain it in scouting unless it's about 10x longer. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303") 16:35, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)

One Q is how is scouting "non-technical" if it envolves solely upon computers? as in my teams case. Just wondering about the duality of scouting. Some use just paper others use computers. --[Stefan](User:Stefan "User:Stefan") 16:15, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)

I believe the distinction of "technical" vs. "non-technical" is somewhat undefined now. For instance, scouting can be a very technical endeavor ... and so can team management. The intent, I think, is to separate pursuits directly related to the robot and pursuits related to the team as a whole, -- though currently it is somewhat arbitrary at points. Please see [FIRSTwiki:Village pump](FIRSTwiki:Village_pump "FIRSTwiki:Village pump" ) (Browse by topic section) for a discussion on a better organization scheme, and add your input. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 16:28, 30 Jun 2004 (EDT)
