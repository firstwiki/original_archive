The male plug is connected towards the pc in the automobile as well as the female plug is for connecting using the automobile components on which the verify has to be created. Information collected by the OBD2 sensors is read by the personal computer by the OBD2 connector from it just [click here](http://www.kfzdiagnosegeraet.de/ "http://www.kfzdiagnosegeraet.de/")!.

For one of the most advanced onboard diagnostics, the OBD2, a female 16 pin OBD2 connector is required for standardized interface with hardware. It have to comply with SAE J1962 standards. J1962 requirements obviously specify the function of every pin. Some pins are left with no particular functions. They're meant to become made use of at the discretion of the vehicle manufacturer.

In 2008, compliance with signaling requirements for all automobiles sold inside the Usa was created mandatory. In 2010 it really is mandatory for particular chosen heavy duty commercial autos also. The new complicated OBD2 technique helps preserve a clean environment along with effortless diagnostics.

A very good OBD2 connector could be the heart of an OBD2 method. Consequently, selecting the best OBD2 system is of paramount value [auto diagnostics](http://www.kfzdiagnosegeraet.de/ "http://www.kfzdiagnosegeraet.de/").
