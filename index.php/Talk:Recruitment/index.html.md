# Talk:Recruitment

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

I saw that there didn't seem to be a page related to recruitment, so I created
a link to a new page for a recruitment article. I was trying to "be bold," so
please be nice. I hope I put this page in an appropriate location and didn't
miss something similar elsewhere. I just wrote it now, and it needs to be read
over and edited, updated, expanded upon, etc.

    Seems fine. My only concern is that it's a fairly large article w/o any sections. --[Astronouth7303](User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 17:08, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    Yeah, see that's what I mean...I don't really know what you mean by "sections" or what you want in terms of formatting. So someone else get on that. (*is brand-new and still learning*) The content is the important part, right? =) --[LauraN](User:LauraN "User:LauraN" ) 17:31, 13 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

Right.

To create sections, use equal signs:

## Contents

  * 1 section 1
    * 1.1 section 1A
    * 1.2 section 1B
  * 2 Section 2
    * 2.1 Section 2a
      * 2.1.1 a very deep section  
---  
  

# section 1


## section 1A


## section 1B


# Section 2


## Section 2a

which is written as:  
=section 1=  
==section 1A==  
==section 1B==  
=Section 2=  
==Section 2a==  
You can only do this as 6 deep.


###### a very deep section
