Lunacy was the challenge for the 2009 robotics season. This game was played on
a special surface and slick wheels to simulate driving in one-sixth of the
gravity experienced on earth to approximate the conditions on the moon. Each
of six robots pulled a trailer that served as a goal for the opposing
alliance. There were two alliances of three teams each. Alliances had to get
special balls, or "moon rocks", into opposing the alliance's trailers to score
points.


## Game play

During the autonomous period, robots began at designated areas called launch
pads in front of an opposing human player. This year, robots were permitted to
block and pin others to prevent progress as long as they did not entangle one
another. Robots could also use cameras to track and score in other robots by
using vision targets at the top of the trailers. At the sides of the playing
field were outpost stations, where human players known as payload specialists
threw moon rocks into moving trailers. This was also done at the refueling
stations, located at the corners of the field.

During the teleoperated (manual control) period, drivers and operators guided
the robots as they attempted to launch moon rocks into opposing trailers.
Payload specialists also threw cells into trailers during this time.
Additionally, robots could push loose cells into the refueling stations.

Outpost payload specialists could feed an empty cell into a robot, which were
deliver them to the fueling station, where they were switched for super cells,
which were worth 15 points. Only one super cell could be retrieved at a time,
and they could only be used during the last 20 seconds of the match.
Otherwise, they were treated as an empty cell.
