Before starting, it is imperative that you have a clean environment to work
in, with plenty of space and adequate ventilation. Its generally considered a
good idea to limit your intake of gaseous heavy metals, and good air
circulation also keeps components cool. You will need a metal (or other non-
flammable) surface on which to work. Secure all of your components (even if
it's just two wires) in the position you want them bonded in. This can be
accomplished through any means (duct-tape, weights, clips, etc.) but you may
find a [Soldering
Aid](http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=soldering%20aid&hl=en
"http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=soldering%20aid&hl=en" ) helpful. Here
are the basic steps to creating a good joint:

  * **Cleanliness** \- All surfaces being soldered should be in direct contact with the molten solder. Any foreign particles will have a disasterous effect on the quality of the joint (_Dirt is the archenemy of a quality soldered joint!_). 
    * Ensure that the soldering tip is in good condition by "tinning" it. This is done by applying a few millimeters of solder to the tip and wiping it on a damp sponge. Using a tip-cleaner (a chunk of flux/solder mix) is also helpful. Keep the tip clean between uses. 
    * Use a small hand held file or knife to scrape off any oxidized metal or grease. This is espescially important with copper, which builds up a layer of oxidation that will thwart your efforts to make the solder "take" (ie bond, stick, join). The surfaces to be joined should be lusterous and shiny. 
  * **Correct Solder Type** \- For almost all applications in FIRST you will want 40/60 rosin core solder (40% tin and 60% silver or lead). Flux should not be necessary due to the rosin already in the solder. The gauge of solder is a matter of prefrence but you should also take into account the job being done. **WARNING**: Do not use plumbers solder or specialty solders for silver or aluminium unless you know what you're doing! 
  * **Temperature** \- Heat should be applied as equally as possible to both surfaces, as a difference in temperature may cause problems. **WARNING**: You should not solder an integrated circuit directly if you are inexperienced, as they are easy to damage. Beginners should use a heat shunt or an integrated circuit socket. 
    1. Before applying any solder you should heat the surfaces being joined by holding the iron to them. 
    2. Heat the joint with the tip of the iron, then continue heating while applying solder. More heat should be added for larger joints. 
    3. Remove the iron (not the solder) first and allow the joint to cool. 
    4. If soldering multistrand wire use small amounts of solder to fuse both wires seperetly into a single strand of wire. Then fuse the two wires into a single wire.

##  Common Pitfalls

  * All Time Worst Beginner Mistake: Dabbing the iron in solder, getting a little globule hanging off the iron, and dabbing it on the joint. If this works, consider it a miracle, and an undoubtedly short-lived one at that. 
  * Solder guns under no circumstances to be used for electronics. 
  * Applying too much heat to components is a good way to fry them. If you can't tin something, stop, and use an alternate joining method. 
  * Applying too much or too little solder. Knowing how much to apply comes only with practice.

##  Conclusion

[Soldering](/index.php/Soldering "Soldering" ) is an essential skill that is
best mastered through practice. Have fun, and don't breathe too deep.
