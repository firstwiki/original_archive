# Introduction

One of the many non-technical obstacles faced by rookie and veteran teams
alike is recruitment. It can be difficult to attract and retain members of a
FIRST team because of the large time committment involved. Also, many students
(especially underclassmen) can easily become overwhelmed by the mere scope of
the project. Building an entire robot from scratch seems like such an esoteric
task that many give up before they even start.


## Two Important Considerations

There are 2 important facts to consider. These will work in the favor of teams
looking to recruit new members, as long as they advertise them properly.

  1. FIRST is about learning. The goal of the FIRST organization is to introduce and encourage the study of science and technology, especially to students who would have otherwise not had such opportunities. Part of [gracious professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious professionalism" ) is a willingness to spread knowledge and experience to others. It is important for teams to make it clear that absolutely no previous experience is necessary- the least informed rookie can quickly and easily become a knowledgeable veteran through dedication and hard work. 
  2. There is something for everyone in FIRST. Students who are unwilling to "get their hands dirty" may be perfect candidates for the Autodesk Inventor team. Students who have no interest in engineering may be interested in making the team animation, creating the team webpage, or designing team logos with photo editing software. The same rule applies- no previous experience is necessary. Even students with no interest in technology can be a vital part of the team by creating poster for the Spirit team, writing letters requestion sponsorship for the fundraising team, or helping the PR team write the Chairman's Award submission. 


# Actively Recruiting

Teams that can clearly convey these 2 important facts about FIRST to your
school community will find many willing and interested students. However, it
is still necessary to draw attention to the team and make sure that interested
students are comfortable with approaching team members for information. Here
are some specific ideas for recruitment:


## Specific Activities

  * Encourage team members to wear their team shirts to school on specific days to raise awareness about the team. 
  * Advertise the team by displaying colorful posters around the school. 
  * Plan a meeting for interested students and announce the details on your school's morning announcements. 
  * Keep a list of students who have expressed interest so that you can keep them updated on the team. 
  * Ask your administration if you can give demonstrations of your robot at school pep rallies or assemblies. 
  * Hand out brochures at Freshman Orientation to get students interested before they even attend the school. 
  * Hold fundraiser/recruitment events. Charge students $1 for a chance to drive your robot for one minute during lunch. The students become interested, your team gets money, and your drive team can get an idea of young talent that may be interested in becoming drivers. 
  * Encourage members to invite their friends to join, or to at least attend competitions and demonstrations. 
  * Write articles about Robotics for your school's newspaper. 


## Outside Sources for Ideas

  * As always, [the ChiefDelphi forum](/index.php/ChiefDelphi "ChiefDelphi" ) is an excellent place to look for ideas.
