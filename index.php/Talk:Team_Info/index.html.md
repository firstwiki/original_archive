##  Split this page?

Wow, this page is already very long. Should we split it into several sections?

  * I think the page getting long was inevitable, it's just like the team list page. Theres just so much information that theres no good way to break it up into separate sections without it still being huge. This is more of a list than an article so some of the size rules don't apply. I'd say just leave everything where it is, in a nice central location.

GeoHack" )]

##  GeoHack

Would it be possible to link each of the lat/long values like it is done on
Wikipedia? Example:

[0011](/index.php/11 "11" ) |  [40 51 31 N, 74 42 53 W](http://tools.wikimedia
.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=40_51_31.00_N_74_42_53.00_W "http://tools.w
ikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=40_51_31.00_N_74_42_53.00_W" ) |
[1997](/index.php/Category:Rookie_1997 "Category:Rookie 1997" ) |  USA |  Y |
Y |  \-  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---

Conventional location info" )]

##  Conventional location info

I think it would be more useful for everyday users if we included columns for
city/state/country data alongside lat/long data. Example:

[0011](/index.php/11 "11" ) |  [40 51 31 N, 74 42 53 W](http://tools.wikimedia
.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=40_51_31.00_N_74_42_53.00_W "http://tools.w
ikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=40_51_31.00_N_74_42_53.00_W" ) |
[1997](/index.php/Category:Rookie_1997 "Category:Rookie 1997" ) |

"wikipedia:Flanders,_NJ" ) |  [NJ](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey
"wikipedia:New_Jersey" ) |  USA |  Y |  Y |  \-  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---

EDIT: And once someone decides to make a [Index of teams by
state](/index.php/Index_of_teams_by_state "Index of teams by state" ), we
could change the state links (in the example above, NJ links to Wikipedia:New
Jersey) to categories of teams in each state. One step at a time, though.

Organize Code" )]

##  Organize Code

Would it be possible to organize the code used here so people can distinguish
between each different line? The way its set up now I'm sure many users get
scared away from editing for fear of screwing up the code. If it's at all
possible to split it up so that each line on the table is seperated in the
code, it would be very helpful. [Cbale2000](/index.php/User:Cbale2000

Team adding script?" )]

##  Team adding script?

Would it be possible to create a script to add teams to this list
automatically? It wouldn't be able to get GPS information of course, but it
would save time by automatically adding information we already have (team
number and page link, rookie year, ect.). I've seen scripts used for this type
of thing before so I figured might be worth using one here as well.
