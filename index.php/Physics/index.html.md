# Physics

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Physics is the science of matter and energy and the interactions between each.
By applying formulas, such as those described by Isaac Newton, it is possible
to reasonably predict the behavior of such objects. In the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](/index.php/FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition" ), high school students apply classroom physics to real-world
problems involving concepts such as [torque](/index.php/Torque "Torque" ),
[friction](/index.php?title=Friction&action=edit "Friction" ),
[work](/index.php?title=Work&action=edit "Work" ), and
[momentum](/index.php?title=Momentum&action=edit "Momentum" ).

The physics articles here cover the calculations and considerations, both
theoretical and applied, that need to be made when constructing a
[robot](/index.php/Robot "Robot" ). For a more general article, see [Physics
on Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/physics "wikipedia:physics" ).
