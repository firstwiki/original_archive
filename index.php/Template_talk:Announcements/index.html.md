### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Added an announcement for First Lego League 2005. The FLL forum has recently
opened. Once more teams have gotten started I'll be posting an announcement to
the FLL forum inviting teams to create pages on FIRSTwiki and updating FLL
content. Hopefully that will generate some page edits. Thought it would be
nice if first thing they notice is an FLL announcement. I didn't remove any
announcements as I wouldn't know what takes precedence, but it is getting a
bit longish. Regards, --[PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll" )
