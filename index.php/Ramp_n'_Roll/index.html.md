Ramp n' Roll Field

The playing field was carpeted and in a T shape. At the junction of the three
sections was the goal area, which consisted of 3 ramps, a flat area on top,
and a football style field goal. There were 36 and 24 inch balls to
manipulate, in the colors of the teams.


## Game Description

Three robots competed at a time. A team recieved 2 points for each time their
small 24" ball was over the goal and 3 points for each time the large ball was
over. The tiebreakers were the highest ball over the goal, and then the
closest ball to the goal.

Rules" )]

## Rules


## Strategies

The winning strategy was to continually pass the balls over the goal. Some
teams could do this faster then the judges could count. This was the first and
only year up until the 2006 game, [Aim High](/index.php/Aim_High "Aim High" ),
that teams scored points based on what happened in a match, as opposed to how
things ended.
