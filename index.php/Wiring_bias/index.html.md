**Wiring bias** is the difference in motor performance when run clockwise and counterclockwise.

Wiring bias is caused by the difference that is usually created by wrapping the windings on the armature angled in a particular direction. This is used in many DC motors in applications where the motor is only run in one direction, or is required to ouput greater power in one direction, a common example being portable drill motors being more powerful in the clockwise (drilling and driving) direction, not counterclockwise.
