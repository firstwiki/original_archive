**Wiring bias** is the difference in motor performance when run clockwise and counterclockwise. 

Wiring bias is caused by the difference that is usually created by wrapping
the windings on the armature angled in a particular direction. This is used in
many DC motors in applications where the motor is only run in one direction,
or is required to ouput greater power in one direction, a common example being
portable drill motors being more powerful in the clockwise (drilling and
driving) direction, not counterclockwise.
