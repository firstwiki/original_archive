# General History

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Formation"
)]

### Formation

The Sciborgs were formed in November of 2002 by three teachers and eight
students, at The Bronx High School of Science, and a Professor at Manhattan
College. It was a rough start for the founding members though. When the team
was started there was little support from the school as well as very little
funding to run a team that usually takes $50,000 to run. The team had too few
tools, too small a work force and, as is the way of Bronx Science students, a
2 hour train ride home for each member. But as is also the way of Bronx
Science Students, the team completed their robot and went on to compete at the
NYC regionals.

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: General
Growth" )]

### General Growth

With the new school year at hand it came time to recruit new members. With
most of the original team still intact, they set out upon the school and
recruited a new set of about eight students. The new workspace for the team
moved to Manhattan College, a new teacher, Mr.Omoloju, had joined the team as
well as new mentor, Jon Cook. With more students and growing interest the team
began to expand. With sponsors such as the Bronx Science Alumni, The Hennessey
Family Foundation, Con-Edison, and the support of the school and family the
Sciborgs had a promising year ahead. After six weeks of work the team had
created an award winning robot. At the 2004 NYC regionals the team reached the
quarter finals and won the Delphi "Driving Tomorrow's Technology" Award for an
innovative stair climbing mechanism.

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Maintaining
The Team" )]

### Maintaining The Team

With the '03-'04 year gone, most of the original team has graduated and the
team lost 3 mentors. But with every graduation there is a new freshmen class
and of course new mentors. The team has grown in popularity within Bronx
Science. The new year brought a multitude of new faces and skills, totaling
over 60 members. The team's new strength and numbers brought a much needed
boost. The Sciborgs shop was relocated to a shop room within Bronx Science. As
the '04-'05 game was released, "Stack Attack", build season kicked in and once
again , according to the rules of FIRST , the robot was shipped off and
competition was at hand. The team once again climbed the ladder and made it to
the quarter finals. But as an added bonus, thanks to great leadership and
organization the team was awarded the Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers
Entrepreneurship Award for great business planning and organization.

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Our First
World Championship" )]

### Our First World Championship

In '05-'06 the team was a Force to be reckoned with in Bronx Science. Boasting
over 60 members with more to come in the freshmen class. Not only had the
sponsorship of the team increased funds to a $35,000 budget. With the new
budget came a new mentor, Thomas Redding a colleague of current mentor Jon
Cook, and many new members. In all of the outreach to local community centers
and word of mouth the team recruited 2 core members from Hostos-Lincoln
Academy for Science as well as two new 12th grade members and a multitude of
freshmen, sophomores and juniors. Work continued on and as always, starting in
January and going for six weeks, the robot was completed to compete in the
"Aim High Challenge". Along with robot building the team held computer classes
at a local nursing home, Women in Engineering day and various other programs.
The outreach program had increased tenfold and at the '06 NYC regional the
Sciborgs were ready. Reaching the quarter-finals for the third year in a row
was a disappointing blow but not for long. The hard work and community
outreach had paid off, because at the awards ceremony the Sciborgs won the
Regional Engineering Inspiration Award, allowing them entrance into the
Championships held in Atlanta, Georgia. The Georgia trip was one for the
record books for the Sciborgs. The first trip to the International
championships and a long deserved trip after 3 years of dedicated work.

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Returning
to The World Championship" )]

### Returning to The World Championship

The '06-'07 year brought many of the same things as years before. New members,
new mentors, more funding and more robotics. But this year brought all of that
multiplied by two. With help from Sponsor Barry Weinberg the Sciborgs worked
with their female colleagues to form an all girls robotics team to build,
compete and share ideas along side with. Both teams worked together in the
same shop space to create two unique robotics designs to compete at NYC. The
Sciborgs competed at both NJ and NYC regionals. At NJ the Sciborgs were
regional finalists thanks to their teammates and the monster defense driving
brought by team captain, George Hsieh. At NYC thanks to their new sister team
the IRON "Fe" Maidens and consistent community outreach they won the highest
honor that FIRST awards, The Regional Chairman's Award, as well as making it
to the quarter finals. Their sister team, after only 5 months in creation and
many community programs held, as well as excellent performance for a rookie
team, was awarded the Rookie All Star Award. These Accomplishments granted
BOTH teams entrance into the Championships. Once again giving them a chance to
compete in the International finals.

# Yearly History

[[edit](/index.php?title=1155&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: 2009" )]

### 2009

The team had a great weekend in Hartford, Connecticut. Although there were a a
couple of tough matches, the team was able to persevere and win the regional.
Thank you GaelForce (Team 126) and Exploding Bacon(Team 1902), it was really
great to work with you both. New York City - The team had a great run but fell
just short of winning the New York City Regional. Thank you Saunders Droid
Factory (Team 2344) and The Technobots (Team 743) for a great run in the
playoffs.

### 2007

The 2007 Sciborgs compete in two regionals for the first time in the team's
five year history. Playing pure defense, Captain George Hsieh's driving brings
home the [New Jersey Regional](/index.php/New_Jersey_Regional "New Jersey
Regional" ) [Finalist](/index.php/Finalist "Finalist" ) Trophy. Two weeks
later, at the [NYC Regional](/index.php/NYC_Regional "NYC Regional" ), the
same strategy does not realize a regional champion or finalist position.
However, the team's efforts in supporting their sister team,
[2265](/index.php/2265 "2265" ) The Fe26 Maidens, does not go unnoticed. With
another first for the team, the 2007 Sciborgs win the NYC Regional [Chairman's
Award](/index.php/Chairman%27s_Award "Chairman's Award" ), bringing the team
to the Championship Event for the second time in as many years.
