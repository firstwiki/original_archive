So far as copyrights go ... the site should be okay, since it is liscenced
under the GFDL. However, you might want to look <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Copyrights#Users'_rights_and_obligations> (having trouble with
external linking currently). Specifically:

If you create a derivative version by changing or adding content, this entails
the following:

  * your materials in turn have to be licensed under GFDL, 
  * you must acknowledge the authorship of the article (section 4B), and 
  * you must provide access to the "transparent copy" of the material (section 4J). (The "transparent copy" of a Wikipedia article is its wiki text.) 

As discussed below in the section **direct link-backs as a compliance
option**, we will regard the latter obligations as fulfilled if you provide a
conspicuous link back to the original article at Wikipedia.org.

Wired didn't put FIRST in all-caps!
