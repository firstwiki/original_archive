So far as copyrights go ... the site should be okay, since it is liscenced under the GFDL. However, you might want to look [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Wikipedia:Copyrights#Users'_rights_and_obligations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Wikipedia:Copyrights#Users'_rights_and_obligations) (having trouble with external linking currently). Specifically:

If you create a derivative version by changing or adding content, this entails the following:

- your materials in turn have to be licensed under GFDL,
- you must acknowledge the authorship of the article (section 4B), and
- you must provide access to the "transparent copy" of the material (section 4J). (The "transparent copy" of a Wikipedia article is its wiki text.)

As discussed below in the section **direct link-backs as a compliance option**, we will regard the latter obligations as fulfilled if you provide a conspicuous link back to the original article at Wikipedia.org.
