what you don’t ask for”.

Bio: Steve Rourke is NiagaraFIRST's do-it-all executive sponsor, and serves as
Engineering Director for General Motors of Canada – St. Catharines Powertrain.
Working with all three teams, Steve helps to grow FIRST in the Niagara area.
He described his role in the program for us: "I’m quite surprised (yet
honored) by this selection, since my teams try to keep me away from the robots
as part of their winning strategy. I tried to drive it once and crashed it
into the wall. They prefer that I keep my sights set on intently growing FIRST
in the Niagara Region of Ontario – with the objective of ensuring that these
teams are working towards FIRST’s compelling vision, and that they have the
highest caliber mentors and organizational support available. My function is
akin to that of a chef – responsible for the ingredients of a successful
organization. For me, success is about growth. But it must be winning growth.
Not necessarily by winning on the field, but by winning within the team – by
stirring in the critical ingredients, such as engaged and inspired students;
motivated, determined, and capable mentors and teachers; highly organized team
systems; objective based plans; relentless pursuit of goals; inter-personal
harmony and teamwork. I’ve found that if you have these ingredients, then you
will more than likely experience the benefit from another of my favorite
quotes…..”The harder you work, the luckier you get”. Once you prepare a
winning team with the winning ingredients, then you can grow that in another
team – and then another, and another. We use collaboration as a growth
strategy to add strong ingredients to a new team, share common expenses
between teams to minimize costs, and share lessons learned and common
standards to accelerate learning. That’s what we have for the vision of teams
collaborating in NiagaraFIRST.org. As an executive with one of the major
sponsors, my position affords me the opportunity to use FIRST as a leadership
development opportunity for mentors – and I have been able to “recruit” some
of the best professional talent. For those of you that know Derek, Karthik,
Ian M., Matt, Stephanie, Kate, Tony, Dan, Co, Ian J., Christa, Lukasz, Curtis,
Wayne (so sorry if I missed anyone), you’ll know what I mean. These
outstanding mentors work with the teams in the foreground, while I applaud in
the background."

Steve also had a very inspiring FIRST memory to share with us. "Watching the
Canadian flag being paraded enthusiastically around the auditorium in Long
Island New York as the students from FRC Team 1114 “Simbotics” frantically
celebrated their victory at that regional event a few years ago. It was at
that moment that I realized the 25 students we had engaged and inspired in the
Niagara Region were hundreds too few. Something had to be done. And we set
about doing it, with a lot of help from my fellow FIRST friends who shared the
vision."

Steve also told us a little bit about NiagaraFIRST and its mission. "We’ve
developed a support network called NiagaraFIRST.org that links teams together
and affords the opportunity for regional collaboration for the purpose of
growth and to leverage and share resources. We began in the fall of 2002 with
one high school – Governor Simcoe’s Team 1114 “Simbotics” that included 25
students. Since then, we’ve grown to three Robotics Teams and have branched
into FIRST LEGO League in an explosive fashion – growing FLL in Niagara from 2
teams to 14 teams in one year, and hosting the FLL Niagara Championship this
year with 21 teams participating. Within three years, we’ve grown FIRST
involvement in Niagara from 25 students to over 200 that are being inspired to
be future science and technology heroes. And we’re not content to leave it at
that. The Niagara Region still has room for growth, and we’ve initiated
discussion with enthusiastic local school boards and trustees that have
expressed interest in helping to facilitate that growth, with more teams for
2006."

Although we didn't need much convincing, Steve has a powerful pitch for people
newly introduced to FIRST. "As I pitched FIRST recently to the trustees of the
local school board, my presentation included the following slide text…..”FIRST
offers THE BEST extra-curricular educational experiences available today for
students to become inspired in mathematics, science, engineering, computer
science, business, and leadership”."

Lastly, Steve gave us a few words to reflect upon: "Begin with the end in
mind. Work hard, play hard, and get along with everybody while you work
towards that end. If you don’t like something, change it. If you can’t change
it, then change the way you think about it."

Congratulations to Steve Rourke, our 47th Unsung FIRST Hero.
