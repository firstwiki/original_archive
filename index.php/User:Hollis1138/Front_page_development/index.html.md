Starting in 2007, USB devices can be used instead of joysticks with the use of
the [USB chicklet](/index.php?title=USB_chicklet&action=edit "USB chicklet" ).
Teams may find that drivers are more comfortable with a game pad than the
joysticks given in the kit of parts. Since eight additional button inputs are
available, it may be possible to have only one driver operating the robot.
While the chicklet is an attractive option for drivers, it can make the
programmer's job more difficult.
