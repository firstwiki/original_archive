Spoiler Game Piece

A spoiler is a [Game Object](Game_Object "Game Object") in the 2007 game used to negate a [Ringer](Ringer "Ringer"). Both spoilers and ringers are large, inflatable pool floats. They are fitted over the [Spider Legs](/index.php?title=Spider_Legs&action=edit "Spider Legs"). See Strategy Discussion under [Rack 'n' Roll](Rack_%27n%27_Roll "Rack 'n' Roll").
