# Interrupts

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

An **interrupt**, as its name implies, _interrupts_ the normal course of a
program and executes a certain piece of code, usually related to whatever
input caused the interrupt.

In FIRST, an intterupt can be used to interrupt the [main
loop](/index.php?title=Main_loop&action=edit "Main loop" ) in the [default
code](Default_code "Default code" ). Interrupts can be set to occur
for a variety of reasons; timers, digital inputs, pwm inputs, etc. The code
that is run when an interrupt happens is called the [interrupt service
routine](/index.php?title=Interrupt_service_routine&action=edit "Interrupt
service routine" ) (ISR).
