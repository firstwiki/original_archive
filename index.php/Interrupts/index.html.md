# Interrupts

## From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

An **interrupt**, as its name implies, _interrupts_ the normal course of a program and executes a certain piece of code, usually related to whatever input caused the interrupt.

In FIRST, an intterupt can be used to interrupt the [main loop](/index.php?title=Main_loop&action=edit "Main loop") in the [default code](Default_code "Default code"). Interrupts can be set to occur for a variety of reasons; timers, digital inputs, pwm inputs, etc. The code that is run when an interrupt happens is called the [interrupt service routine](/index.php?title=Interrupt_service_routine&action=edit "Interrupt
service routine") (ISR).
