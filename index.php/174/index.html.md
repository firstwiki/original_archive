##  History

The Arctic Warriors are the members of the Liverpool High School Robotics
team. Liverpool is a suburb of Syracuse, New York. The Arctic Warriors name is
a combination of the school's mascot (the warriors) and the cold, snowy
climate experienced in Liverpool during the Robotics season.


##  Team projects

Each year the team does community service projects. These have included canned
food drives and book drives.
