## History

Plans for a first ever FIRST Wisconsin Regional were announced in 2005\. 2006 saw the very first competition which played host to 34 teams from 7 different states within the Midwest Area. This regional is usually held the second or third week in the competition season.

The Wisconsin Regional is a medium to large regional with 34 teams attending in 2006, 52 teams in 2007, and 60 teams in 2008\. The regional usually hosts teams from the Midwest Area, but teams from other parts of the US have attended the regional. In 2008 a team from Hawaii was in attendance.

## Location

The Wisconsin Regional competition is held at the US Cellular Arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is Milwaukee's 12,700-seat home for sports, entertainment and assemblies since 1950\. The arena is host to the MISL Milwaukee Wave, UW-Milwaukee Panthers, CIFL Milwaukee Bonecrushers, and other traveling events.

One of the first TV-friendly venues in the nation, the then-"Milwaukee Arena" came of age with rock & roll and later gained fame as "MECCA," a house of champions with a reputation for unparalleled fan intensity and an audacious Pop Art basketball floor. A major 1998 renovation readied the building for the 21st century with new technology and enhanced accommodations for both patrons and productions, while retaining its fervor-inducing geometry and super- strong, ready-to-rig ceiling.

For this event the arena us usually split. The front half contains the playing field and the back half is used for team pits. Team pits are also located beneath the stands on one side of the building.

## Team Social

The team social for the Wisconsin Regional moves annually. The first team social was held at the Milwaukee County Zoo. In 2007 the team social was held at the Italian Community Center, and in 2008 at Discovery World at Pier Wisconsin. The social is usually held the Friday night of the competition from 6 to 9 PM. Teams are able to eat a catered dinner and in 2008 had access to all of the exhibits at Discovery World. Teams must sign up to attend the social in advance.
