## Game Description

information, like how much each scoring object was worth and what had to be
done with it.


## Field Layout

Describe the layout of the field and location of the scoring objects. Include
a description of the scoring objects. A picture is really nice in this area.


## Tournament Structure

of the elimination rounds. Make sure any differences between the elimination
rounds and the seeding rounds are clear. Touch on any differences between
regionals and the Championship.

changes from previous years.


## Rules
