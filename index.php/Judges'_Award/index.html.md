The **Judges' Award** is given to a [team](Team "Team") which the judges feel exhibit special qualities that deserve to be recognized, although they do not qualify for a regular award.

## Example

An example would be Team [1396](1396 "1396"), which won the Judges' Award at [The Championship Event](The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event") in 2004 as a result of their [One-Day Wonder](Team_1396%27s_%22One-Day_Wonder%22 "Team 1396's "One-Day
Wonder"") - a robot the team built with the help of team [494](494 "494") in the span of ten hours on the first day of the event.
