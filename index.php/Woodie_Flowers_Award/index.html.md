# Woodie Flowers Award

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

The **Woodie Flowers Award**, named after [Woodie
Flowers](/index.php/Woodie_Flowers "Woodie Flowers" ), celebrates effective
communication in the art and science of engineering and design. [Dr. William
Murphy](/index.php?title=Dr._William_Murphy&action=edit "Dr. William Murphy" )
and Small Parts, Inc. began this prestigious award in 1996 to recognize
mentors who lead, inspire, and empower using excellent communication skills.
In simpler terms, a good WFA candidate is someone who works with students,
both teaching them and inspiring them in their goals.

The candidate for the award is picked by the students on each team. The
students then write an essay describing the qualities of their candidate.

[FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) recognizes one adult team member at each of
the 37 regional competitions as a **Woodie Flowers Award** regional winner. Of
these talented mentors, one will receive the Woodie Flowers Award at [The
Championship Event](/index.php/The_Championship_Event "The Championship Event"
) in Atlanta.
