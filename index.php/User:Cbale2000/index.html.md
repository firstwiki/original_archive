## Comments

  * Phew, I had some time on my hands today so I started going through every single team page and checked for errors, adding necessary templates to them as I went. I got to all the teams below 200 (hence the over 200 edits on the "recent changes" list today). Thats enough for today I think *fingers start to fall off*. **Cbale2000** 23:58, 28 June 2007 (EDT) 
  * Users, PLEASE check the [formats page](/index.php/FIRSTwiki:Page_formats "FIRSTwiki:Page formats" ) before you create or change an article. All to often I have seen pages that are completely out of format and so it would save us all a lot of time if everyone checks for the correct format first. Thank you. **Cbale2000** 12:42, 25 September 2007 (EDT) 
  * Today I discovered the [Random page](/index.php/Special:Random "Special:Random" ) button... FIRSTwiki will never be the same again!  :D **Cbale2000** 13:32, 4 October 2007 (EDT) 
  * CURSE YOU SPAMBOTS!! CURSE YOUUUUUUUUU!!! &gt;:( **Cbale2000** 19:30, 7 August 2009 (EDT)
