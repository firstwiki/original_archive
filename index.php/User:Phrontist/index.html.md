ToDo List" )]

##  ToDo List

These are my pet projects. Look foward to many updates. My general strategy
is:

  1. Find some nodes whose lack of content bothers me 
  2. Get in contact with known experts in the feild. (For instance I PMed Wildstang about doing [StangPS](/index.php/StangPS "StangPS" )) 
  3. Spend time collecting links 
  4. Dump the links onto the page 
  5. Distill the information into a nice, clean, article

###  Pet Project of The Moment

Programming articles need improvement.


##  Biographical Information (see: My Massive Ego)

I go to [George Mason High School](http://team1418.org "http://team1418.org"
), home of [Team 1418](http://team1418.org "http://team1418.org" ) [Vae
Victus](http://team1418.org "http://team1418.org" ).

Hey! This whole wiki is my fault. I'm sorry, and I hope I am someday forgiven.
I'm not trying to give an excuse or anything, but [Max](/index.php/User:Max
"User:Max" ) actually installed MediaWiki, and
[SilverStar](/index.php/User:SilverStar "User:SilverStar" ) has been slaving
away, fleshing out nodes.

I'm a founding member of [1418](/index.php/1418 "1418" ).

Well, time for some biographical info, so I can dodge questions with a snide
"That info is on the wiki" followed by a derisive snort. I work for [Aurora
Flight Sciences](http://www.aurora.aero "http://www.aurora.aero" ) where I
will be writing code to display telemetry data for the [Golden-Eye
OAV](http://www.aurora.aero/tactical/GoldenEye-50.html
"http://www.aurora.aero/tactical/GoldenEye-50.html" ). I live inside the
beltway in the comfortable hamlet of [The City of Falls
Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_Church" ) where I attend [George Mason
High School](http://www.fccps.k12.va.us/gm/ "http://www.fccps.k12.va.us/gm/"
). [My resume](http://phrontist.org/resume.html
"http://phrontist.org/resume.html" ) and [my website](http://phrontist.org
"http://phrontist.org" ) may prove englightening.

I look like the picture below. See that pocket protector? Yeah, that's our
uniform next year :-) I'm not kidding! I'm a pocket-protector afictianado and
my team was easily convinced. Nerd Pride!
