# Teacher

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Teachers, [Mentors](/index.php/Mentors "Mentors" ) and Parents make up the
non-student aspect of [FIRST](http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/index.html
"http://www.usfirst.org/robotics/index.html" ) Robotics Competition team. FRC
teams are in most cases supported by a school, to some degree, though some do
exist independant of educational institutions. The sterotype original
sponsoring teacher is a mathematics, physics, engineering or other science
teacher, though by all means, not all teachers are.

The two types of Teachers are Engineering and Non-engineering (see
[NEMO](/index.php/NEMO "NEMO" ) the Non-Engineering Mentors Orangization for
more info). Engineering teachers support the team by providing assistance with
[CAD](/index.php/CAD "CAD" ), design and construction as well as non-
engineering tasks. Non-engineering mentors contribute to the program by
helping students with their [chairmans
award](/index.php?title=Chairmans_award&action=edit "Chairmans award" ) entry,
animation, fundraising and team coordination and theming. Neither list of jobs
is complete by any means, and in many cases, Teachers jobs may overlap.
