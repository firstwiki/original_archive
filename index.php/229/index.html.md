##  History

DIVISION BY ZERO is a FIRST Robotics team based at Clarkson University in
Potsdam, NY. Our team is comprised of students and faculty from Clarkson
University, Massena High School, and Salmon River High School. Each year we
compete in various regional and national robotic sporting events put on by
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a company
dedicated to inspiring high school students into technical careers. Clarkson
engineering students participate to help inspire local high school students in
robotics and technology. Our team is represented by the Division by Zero
whirlwind logo, and our team motto and slogan.

Team 229 was started in October 1998, by [Kimberly
O’Toole](/index.php?title=Kimberly_O%E2%80%99Toole&action=edit "Kimberly
O’Toole" ), a freshman electrical engineering student at Clarkson and a
veteran of FIRST Robotics team number 176. Students from the university
volunteer their time to mentor high school students from Massena High School
and Salmon River High School. We work hard to find community support by doing
demonstrations of our robots at local organizations. We are also working with
the local elementary schools to form several Lego league teams, and several
local middle schools in order to form several Tech Challenge teams.

##  Team projects

Through Clarkson University and other local sponsors team 229 has been able to
start a successful FLL organization in each of Massena Central's Elementary
Schools along with an FTC team in their Junior High School. In 2007, the team
ran and sponsored a FLL and FTC event which took place at Clarkson University.
