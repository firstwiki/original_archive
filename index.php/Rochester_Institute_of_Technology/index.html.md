## History

The Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) has been involved with
[FIRST](FIRST "FIRST" ) in various forms since 1996.

From 1996 to 1998, the special interest housing floor called Engineering House
mentored team [73](73 "73" ). This was the high point of team 73's
history, winning a National Championship and 2 Photogenic Awards (now called
[Imagery Award](Imagery_Award "Imagery Award" )). Team 73 folded
after the 1998 season.

In 2000, RIT freshmen Matt Leese and Jeff Zampieron revived some interest in
RIT and found enough funding from various sponsors to restart team 73 for the
2001 season.

However, lack of funding was again an issue, and team 73 couldn't compete in
2002. However, RIT stayed involved by mentoring team [340](340
"340" ).

In 2003, Bausch and Lomb started to sponsor team 73, and once again RIT was
involved in mentoring team 73.

In 2004, besides mentoring 73, several students also mentored team
[1405](1405 "1405" ).

RIT will be the host for the [Finger Lakes
Regional](Finger_Lakes_Regional "Finger Lakes Regional" ) in 2005.
