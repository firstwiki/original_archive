## Current Topics

## History

We really need solid history about FIRST, but usfirst.org doesn't really provide enough factual information to make a solid article. Accumulate sources and information about the history here that'll go into this section. [Boydean](User:Boydean "User:Boydean") 23:05, 14 March 2010 (EDT)

## Inspiration, Recognition, Science, and Technology Pages

Noticed the [Inspiration](Inspiration "Inspiration"), [Recognition](Recognition "Recognition"), [Science](Science "Science"), and [Technology](Technology "Technology") pages from the [FIRST](first) article. They don't seem very useful to me and I'm not sure what would be added there. Kinda obvious isn't it? Recommend they be removed unless there's something to fill 'em with.

Agreed, we can change the links on the [FIRST](first) article to point to the wikipedia pages. [Boydean](User:Boydean "User:Boydean" ) 22:04, 14 March 2010 (EDT) 

eerr, or we could link to the wiktionary articles....I'll go ahead and do that [Boydean](User:Boydean "User:Boydean" ) 22:24, 14 March 2010 (EDT) 

 What about linking all four of them to a single "[FIRST (acronym)](/index.php?title=FIRST_%28acronym%29&action=edit "FIRST \(acronym\)" )" page, where we could break down the name, reasoning, and vision behind it, from that page, we could also have links to each words corresponding wiktionary articles. [Cbale2000](User:Cbale2000 "User:Cbale2000" ) 22:28, 14 March 2010 (EDT) 

 I suppose, we have to make the page though. [Boydean](User:Boydean "User:Boydean" ) 22:59, 14 March 2010 (EDT) 
 After thinking about the page for a bit (or rather staring at the edit box), I couldn't think of what would go on there, besides the general definition of the term and how it applied to FIRST. That could fit in just the FIRST page in a section? [Tanner](User:TannerLD "User:TannerLD" ) 21:06, 16 March 2010 (EDT)

### Wrong page, Wrong name?

Not sure I agree that this article should be about the [FIRST Robotics Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition"). Couple of things I'm thinking here...

- The [FIRST Robotics Competition](first-robotics-competition) page redirects to [FIRST](first)
- The [FIRST](first) page says at the top that FLL has its own alternative page. That doesn't make sense. FIRST is a non-profit organization, not a competition.

Therefore in my opinion the content of the [FIRST](first) page should be copied over to the [FIRST Robotics Competition](FIRST_Robotics_Competition "FIRST Robotics
Competition") page which should no longer redirect. The [FIRST](first) page should focus on FIRST as a non profit organization (referencing the competitions created and sponsored by FIRST as needed).

Here is a quote from the USFirst website...

"FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a multinational non-profit organization, that aspires to transform culture, making science, math, engineering, and technology as cool for kids as sports are today."

Any thoughts?-[PeterFll](User:PeterFll "User:PeterFll") 08:41, 23 Jun 2005 (EDT)

### Wrong Page

I agree this content is on the wrong page and should be put onto a FRC page. FIRST is more than just the robotics competition, it includes FRC, FVC, FLL, FIRST Place, and more. FIRST was founded in 1989 while FRC wasn't started until 1992\. With this little tidmit of information being wrong it should show that the current content should be moved and new content created.
