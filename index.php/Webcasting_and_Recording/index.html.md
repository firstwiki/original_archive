## Important Notes

Make sure you talk to the regional organizers as early as possible. Internet
is generally not available at the regionals except through the regional
coordinators. Additionally, make sure you will have space near the video
connection for a computer or two.

China.

### Naming Conventions

From Team 108

**General Naming Rules**

  * Two or three character event abbreviation in lowercase, e.g. "fl" 
  * Underscore, "_" 
  * Then one of the following: 
    * Qualification: Use THREE digits, "001", "047", "108". 
    * Elimination: Use "qf4m2", "sf2m1", "fm3" 
    * Awards: Use "award_" + AwardDescription. 
    * Opening: Use "openingremarks_" + "friday" or "saturday". 
    * Closing: Use "closingremarks_" + "friday" or "saturday". 
    * Else: any string that does not begin with "qf", "sf", "fm", or a digit. 
  * ".wmv" (or whatever format extension you encoded, hopefully windows media) 

Notes:

  * Always use lowercase, please. 
  * No spaces in a filename, please. 
  * Sometimes a match gets replayed- name the one that counts in the standings as "fl_001.wmv". The one(s) that do NOT count, "fl_001bad1.wmv", "fl_001bad2.wmv", etc...
