Should pages that have already been created really be here? The wikipedia version does not permit this. And it seems those articles more properly belong in [FIRSTwiki:Cleanup](FIRSTwiki:Cleanup "FIRSTwiki:Cleanup"). This seems to be the place where non-existant articles are requested. I didn't want to remove most of the reqeusted articles, though, until some consensus was established. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 15:45, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Lacking feedback, I'm going to experiment with the page to test out some ideas. I think it'll be more useful this way. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 19:52, 15 Jun 2004 (EDT)

This page being called 'Most wanted' and then having a 'most wanted' special page seems confusing. It took me a second or two to figure out what was going on, and since this is a potential section we want newcomers to be looking at for contributions, maybe a renaming is in order. Maybe 'Suggested articles'? I don't know ... hopefully someone else will be more eloquent than I am. --[Mrawls](User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls") 16:59, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT)

When all else fails, copy wikipedia [wikipedia:wikipedia:Requested articles](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:Requested_articles "wikipedia:wikipedia:Requested_articles" ). Moving now. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max" ) 17:10, 10 Jun 2004 (EDT)

What is the difference between [designing a FIRST webpage](Designing_a_FIRST_webpage "Designing a FIRST webpage") and [designing a team webpage](Designing_a_team_webpage "Designing
a team webpage")?--[Snoldak924](User:Snoldak924 "User:Snoldak924") 18:55, 27 Jun 2004 (EDT)

```
None that I can think of.... --[Goobergunch](User:Goobergunch "User:Goobergunch" ) 19:36, 27 Jun 2004 (EDT)

Why is [Multi-bank programming](Multi-bank_programming "Multi-bank
programming") on this list? It doesn't seem to have anything to do with FIRST/robot programming. [devicenull](User:Devicenull "User:Devicenull") 18:52, 30 January 2006 (EST)

Changed "Mill" to redirect to preexisting "Milling machine" article and removed from list.--[Fourpenguins](/index.php?title=User:Fourpenguins&action=edit "User:Fourpenguins") 14:22, 6 August 2007 (EDT)
