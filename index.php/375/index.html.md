## History

We are FIRST Robotics Competition Team 375, The Robotic Plague. Hailing from
Staten Island, New York, our team strives to encourage a positive view of
science, technology, engineering and math in the heart of our community. While
our team is almost twelve years old, we are ever expanding. With the help of
dedicated mentors, alumni, sponsors and parents, our members experience a team
unlike any other. We are proud to say that although we build engineering
feats, we build spirit, professionalism, and humanitarianism simultaneously.
As we like to say: "There are no problems, only solutions!"


## Team projects
