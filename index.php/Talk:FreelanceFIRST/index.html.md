The official nomenclature is 'freelanceFIRST,' though wiki insists on titling
this page as FreelanceFIRST. How can it be changed? --

    That's just how the software works ... it automatically capitalized the first letter of the title. See [[1]](http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_name#Case-sensitivity_of_the_first_character "http://meta.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_name#Case-sensitivity_of_the_first_character" ) for more information. I think, for [Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) to change it, he would have to make all articles case sensitive, which I don't think is desirable (a lot of links would suddenly be broken). I think, so long as you mention it properly in the text of the article, though, that the title won't be too big of an issue. --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 14:42, 24 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    If the name is later trademarked or some such thing, it will be an issue. Until then, it'll survive, I guess. But, I imagine that it will become an issue. -- [Maddie](/index.php/User:Maddie "User:Maddie" )

    I'm not an expert on trademark law, but I beleive the attempt to defend the trademark is more important then succeeding in it. Thus, this thread should suffice. --[Sciencewhiz](/index.php/User:Sciencewhiz "User:Sciencewhiz" ) 19:16, 26 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    

    I imagine if the uber legal-concious Wikipedia doesn't have a problem with it, we won't either. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:33, 26 Jun 2004 (EDT)
