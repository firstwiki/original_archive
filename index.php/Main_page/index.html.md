A **[drivetrain](Drivetrain "Drivetrain")** consists of components necessary to allow a robot to move. The interaction of those parts, which includes motors and transmissions, result in a robot that is either fast or slow. Good drivetrains result in robots that are maneuverable, fast, and capable of pushing items on the field. Common types of drivetrains used in FIRST include [six-wheel drive](Drivetrain#Six_Wheel_Drive "Drivetrain"), [swerve drive](Drivetrain#Swerve_Drive "Drivetrain"), and [mecanum drive](Drivetrain#Mecanum_Drive "Drivetrain").
