# Talk:Basic HTML

### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Here's what I'm thinking for this page: basic explanation of HTML for true
beginners (how the tags work, how to write them with the &lt;, /, and &gt;
symbols), introduction to some basic tags (bold, center, italics, tables,
images) and then some external links to good sources that provide a more
complete list of tags. If this sounds good to you guys, I'll start working on
it. --[LauraN](/index.php/User:LauraN "User:LauraN" ) 19:37, 14 Jun 2004 (EDT)

    That's alright, but let me make a suggestion: What we need more urgently are FIRST specific stuff as such beginner's guides already exist elsewhere. If you are web-inclined, what about [Designing a team webpage](/index.php/Designing_a_team_webpage "Designing a team webpage" ) where you can discuss elements a good team website should have, etc etc.? --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" ) 19:49, 14 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

    Like Max said, try to keep it FIRST-centric. It would be fine to explain what HTML is, refer to a wikipedia link, and then offer external links to better resources. Also, a howto article on [Designing a team webpage](/index.php/Designing_a_team_webpage "Designing a team webpage" ) would be a good idea (seconding it). In it, i would reference the webpage award, link to several exemplary team websites and provide a general overview of pointers ... but keep the HTML/design/non-FIRST centric stuff to more specialized sources (trust me, just writing a wiki about all the FIRST stuff is quite a task, let alone extending it HTML, CSS, etc.). --[Mrawls](/index.php/User:Mrawls "User:Mrawls" ) 20:09, 14 Jun 2004 (EDT) 

I know we said to stay away from this, but I couldn't resist. =) Obviously
it's a very, very basic introduction. To make up for my act of defiance, I'll
add that "Designing team websites" page later tonight...right now I'm going
outside because it's nice out. --[LauraN](/index.php/User:LauraN "User:LauraN"

standards based html?" )]

##  standards based html?

I notice that among other things this article promotes the use of the _font_
tag. While I understand that this is an easy way for a beginner to see instant
results, shouldn't we stray from presentational markup, especially when
introducing HTML to new people?

[w3c](http://w3.org "http://w3.org" ) web standards dictate that there is no
"color" attribute and the _font_ tag has been depricated.

    So what do you use instead? --[Astronouth7303](/index.php/User:Astronouth7303 "User:Astronouth7303" ) 14:37, 6 Jul 2004 (EDT) 

    

    CSS. Bad mistake on page ... any example will do. Very few people actually use standards based html, -- a problem we shouldn't try to perpetuate!
