### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

**Alumni** are former [FIRST](/index.php/FIRST "FIRST" ) [team](/index.php/Team "Team" ) members. They are encouraged (but hardly obligated) to continually consider [gracious professionalism](/index.php/Gracious_professionalism "Gracious professionalism" ) and maintain a connection to FIRST, perhaps by becoming [mentors](/index.php/Mentor "Mentor" ) or by entering a field in [engineering](/index.php/Engineering "Engineering" ).
