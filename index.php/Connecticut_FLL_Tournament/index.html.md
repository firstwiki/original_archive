## History

Connecticut has been running a state FLL tournament since at least 2000
(Volcanic Panic). Up until the 2004 (No Limits) season there were no
qualifying tournaments and this was the only official tournament in CT. If
more than 50 teams registered a lottery determined which 50 teams would attend
the event.

In 2004, CT switched to a hybrid scheme of qualifying tournaments for 25
spots, and lottery for the other 25 spots. This was billed as a transition
year.

In 2005, CT continued with the hybrid scheme, but modified it to require that
teams had to attend one of the qualifying events to be considered for the
state tournament. At the qualifying events 10 teams would be selected - 5 by
awards, 5 by lottery - to move on to the state tournament.
