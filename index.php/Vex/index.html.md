### From FIRSTwiki

Jump to: navigation, search

Vex is a robotics challenge similar to [FTC](/index.php/FTC "FTC" ).

Someone please flesh this out a little bit. I know a lot about Vex, but I'm
not very good at organizing articles. Once there's some structure, I'll be
able to write more. --[cmh0114](/index.php/User:Cmh0114 "User:Cmh0114" )
