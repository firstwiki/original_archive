I have made you a sysop so that you can edit the front page. I don't think
anyone will mind me bypassing the process that we used previously for
selecting sysops. Have fun and contact me if you need anything.

Go ahead and delete any obviously stupid things like the work of this recent
vandal [24.107.58.43](/index.php?title=24.107.58.43&action=edit "24.107.58.43"
). There aren't really enough admins patrolling to go through the extra work
of voting or anything. --[Max](/index.php/User:Max "User:Max" )
