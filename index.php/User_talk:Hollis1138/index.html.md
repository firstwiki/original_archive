I have made you a sysop so that you can edit the front page. I don't think anyone will mind me bypassing the process that we used previously for selecting sysops. Have fun and contact me if you need anything. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") [[1257](1257 "1257")] 22:41, 28 June 2006 (EDT)

Go ahead and delete any obviously stupid things like the work of this recent vandal [24.107.58.43](/index.php?title=24.107.58.43&action=edit "24.107.58.43"). There aren't really enough admins patrolling to go through the extra work of voting or anything. --[Max](User:Max "User:Max") [[1257](1257 "1257")] 19:17, 25 July 2006 (EDT)
