## History

The team started in 2000 as one of the first FIRST teams in Hawaii. Early on,
they had moderate success and were considered a mid-tier team. Recently, they
have been much more successful, qualifying for Championships every year since
2008. 2010 was an unprecedented year for team 359, winning two regionals and
becoming one of the few teams to have gone undefeated in a regional, doing so
at Hawaii. That year was capped off with a victory at the [Indiana Robotics
Invitational](/index.php/Indiana_Robotics_Invitational "Indiana Robotics
Invitational" ). The continued their success in 2011, again winning two
regionals. Their outstanding recent performance allowed this very involved
team to win the Championship Chairman's Award, placing them in the FIRST Hall
of Fame. In 2011, they won IRI for the second year in a row.
